The 3 types of events represent the start of an animation, the end of a start delay of\n     * an animation, and the end of an animation. When playing forward (i.e. in the non-reverse\n     * direction), start event marks when start() should be called, and end event corresponds to\n     * when the animation should finish. When playing in reverse, start delay will not be a part\n     * of the animation. Therefore, reverse() is called at the end event, and animation should end\n     * at the delay ended event.\n     ",
