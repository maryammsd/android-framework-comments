The {@link SQLiteConnection}\n     * owns the statement object and will take care of freeing it when needed.\n     * In particular, closing the connection requires a guarantee of deterministic\n     * resource disposal because all native statement objects must be freed before\n     * the native database object can be closed.  So no finalizers here.\n     ",
