The information can be extracted from the\n * {@link android.net.NetworkCapabilities} of the network using\n * {@link NetworkCapabilities#getTransportInfo()}.\n * The {@link NetworkCapabilities} is provided by the connectivity service to apps, e.g. received\n * through the\n * {@link android.net.ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback#onCapabilitiesChanged(android.net.Network,\n * android.net.NetworkCapabilities)} callback.\n * <p>\n * The Wi-Fi Aware-specific network information include the peer's scoped link-local IPv6 address\n * for the Wi-Fi Aware link, as well as (optionally) the port and transport protocol specified by\n * the peer.\n * The scoped link-local IPv6, port, and transport protocol can then be used to create a\n * {@link java.net.Socket} connection to the peer.\n * <p>\n * Note: these are the peer's IPv6 and port information - not the local device's!\n ",
