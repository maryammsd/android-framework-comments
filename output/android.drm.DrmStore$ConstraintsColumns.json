The constants defined in this interface\n     * represent three most common types of constraints: count-based,\n     * date-based, and duration-based. Two or more constraints can be used\n     * at the same time to represent more sophisticated constraints.\n     * In addition, user-defined constraint,\n     * {@link #EXTENDED_METADATA extended metadata}, can be\n     * used if these three types of constraints are not sufficient.\n     ",
