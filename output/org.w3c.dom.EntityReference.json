  "comment" : "\n * <code>EntityReference</code> nodes may be used to represent an entity\n * reference in the tree. Note that character references and references to\n * predefined entities are considered to be expanded by the HTML or XML\n * processor so that characters are represented by their Unicode equivalent\n * rather than by an entity reference. Moreover, the XML processor may\n * completely expand references to entities while building the\n * <code>Document</code>, instead of providing <code>EntityReference</code>\n * nodes. If it does provide such nodes, then for an\n * <code>EntityReference</code> node that represents a reference to a known\n * entity an <code>Entity</code> exists, and the subtree of the\n * <code>EntityReference</code> node is a copy of the <code>Entity</code>\n * node subtree. However, the latter may not be true when an entity contains\n * an unbound namespace prefix. In such a case, because the namespace prefix\n * resolution depends on where the entity reference is, the descendants of\n * the <code>EntityReference</code> node may be bound to different namespace\n * URIs. When an <code>EntityReference</code> node represents a reference to\n * an unknown entity, the node has no children and its replacement value,\n * when used by <code>Attr.value</code> for example, is empty.\n * <p>As for <code>Entity</code> nodes, <code>EntityReference</code> nodes and\n * all their descendants are readonly.\n * <p ><b>Note:</b> <code>EntityReference</code> nodes may cause element\n * content and attribute value normalization problems when, such as in XML\n * 1.0 and XML Schema, the normalization is performed after entity reference\n * are expanded.\n * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification</a>.\n ",
