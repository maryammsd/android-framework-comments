All properties listed for capture requests can also\n * be queried on the capture result, to determine the final values used for\n * capture. The result also includes additional metadata about the state of the\n * camera device during the capture.</p>\n *\n * <p>All properties returned by {@link CameraCharacteristics#getAvailableCaptureResultKeys()}\n * are available (that is {@link CaptureResult#get} will return non-{@code null}, if and only if\n * that key that was enabled by the request. A few keys such as\n * {@link CaptureResult#STATISTICS_FACES} are disabled by default unless enabled with a switch (such\n * as {@link CaptureRequest#STATISTICS_FACE_DETECT_MODE}). Refer to each key documentation on\n * a case-by-case basis.</p>\n *\n * <p>For a logical multi-camera device, if the CaptureRequest contains a surface for an underlying\n * physical camera, the corresponding {@link TotalCaptureResult} object will include the metadata\n * for that physical camera. And the mapping between the physical camera id and result metadata\n * can be accessed via {@link #getPhysicalCameraResults}. If all requested surfaces are for the\n * logical camera, no metadata for physical camera will be included.</p>\n *\n * <p>{@link TotalCaptureResult} objects are immutable.</p>\n *\n * @see CameraCaptureSession.CaptureCallback#onCaptureCompleted\n ",
