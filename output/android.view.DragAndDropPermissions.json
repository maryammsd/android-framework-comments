The\n * permissions are revoked when this activity is destroyed, or when {@link #release()} is called,\n * whichever occurs first.\n * </p>\n * <p>\n * If you anticipate that your application will receive a large number of drops (e.g. document\n * editor), you should try to call {@link #release()} on the obtained permissions as soon as they\n * are no longer required. Permissions can be added to your activity's\n * {@link Activity#onSaveInstanceState} bundle and later retrieved in order to manually release\n * the permissions once they are no longer needed.\n * </p>\n * <p>\n * Learn more about <a href=\"/guide/topics/ui/drag-drop#DragPermissionsMultiWindow\">drag permissions\n * in multi-window mode</a>.\n * </p>\n ",
