For\n * example, the platform might store a property \"alpha\" in a transition\n * \"Fader\" as \"android:fader:alpha\".\n *\n * <p>These values are cached during the\n * {@link Transition#captureStartValues(TransitionValues)}\n * capture} phases of a scene change, once when the start values are captured\n * and again when the end values are captured. These start/end values are then\n * passed into the transitions via the\n * for {@link Transition#createAnimator(ViewGroup, TransitionValues, TransitionValues)}\n * method.</p>\n ",
