If metering or focusing area\n     * selection is unsupported, these methods will return 0.</p>\n     *\n     * <p>Each Area consists of a rectangle specifying its bounds, and a weight\n     * that determines its importance. The bounds are relative to the camera's\n     * current field of view. The coordinates are mapped so that (-1000, -1000)\n     * is always the top-left corner of the current field of view, and (1000,\n     * 1000) is always the bottom-right corner of the current field of\n     * view. Setting Areas with bounds outside that range is not allowed. Areas\n     * with zero or negative width or height are not allowed.</p>\n     *\n     * <p>The weight must range from 1 to 1000, and represents a weight for\n     * every pixel in the area. This means that a large metering area with\n     * the same weight as a smaller area will have more effect in the\n     * metering result.  Metering areas can overlap and the driver\n     * will add the weights in the overlap region.</p>\n     *\n     * @see Parameters#setFocusAreas(List)\n     * @see Parameters#getFocusAreas()\n     * @see Parameters#getMaxNumFocusAreas()\n     * @see Parameters#setMeteringAreas(List)\n     * @see Parameters#getMeteringAreas()\n     * @see Parameters#getMaxNumMeteringAreas()\n     *\n     * @deprecated We recommend using the new {@link android.hardware.camera2} API for new\n     *             applications.\n     ",
