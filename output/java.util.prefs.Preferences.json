  "comment" : "\n * A node in a hierarchical collection of preference data.  This class\n * allows applications to store and retrieve user and system\n * preference and configuration data.  This data is stored\n * persistently in an implementation-dependent backing store.  Typical\n * implementations include flat files, OS-specific registries,\n * directory servers and SQL databases.  The user of this class needn't\n * be concerned with details of the backing store.\n *\n * <p>There are two separate trees of preference nodes, one for user\n * preferences and one for system preferences.  Each user has a separate user\n * preference tree, and all users in a given system share the same system\n * preference tree.  The precise description of \"user\" and \"system\" will vary\n * from implementation to implementation.  Typical information stored in the\n * user preference tree might include font choice, color choice, or preferred\n * window location and size for a particular application.  Typical information\n * stored in the system preference tree might include installation\n * configuration data for an application.\n *\n * <p>Nodes in a preference tree are named in a similar fashion to\n * directories in a hierarchical file system.   Every node in a preference\n * tree has a <i>node name</i> (which is not necessarily unique),\n * a unique <i>absolute path name</i>, and a path name <i>relative</i> to each\n * ancestor including itself.\n *\n * <p>The root node has a node name of the empty string (\"\").  Every other\n * node has an arbitrary node name, specified at the time it is created.  The\n * only restrictions on this name are that it cannot be the empty string, and\n * it cannot contain the slash character ('/').\n *\n * <p>The root node has an absolute path name of <tt>\"/\"</tt>.  Children of\n * the root node have absolute path names of <tt>\"/\" + </tt><i>&lt;node\n * name&gt;</i>.  All other nodes have absolute path names of <i>&lt;parent's\n * absolute path name&gt;</i><tt> + \"/\" + </tt><i>&lt;node name&gt;</i>.\n * Note that all absolute path names begin with the slash character.\n *\n * <p>A node <i>n</i>'s path name relative to its ancestor <i>a</i>\n * is simply the string that must be appended to <i>a</i>'s absolute path name\n * in order to form <i>n</i>'s absolute path name, with the initial slash\n * character (if present) removed.  Note that:\n * <ul>\n * <li>No relative path names begin with the slash character.\n * <li>Every node's path name relative to itself is the empty string.\n * <li>Every node's path name relative to its parent is its node name (except\n * for the root node, which does not have a parent).\n * <li>Every node's path name relative to the root is its absolute path name\n * with the initial slash character removed.\n * </ul>\n *\n * <p>Note finally that:\n * <ul>\n * <li>No path name contains multiple consecutive slash characters.\n * <li>No path name with the exception of the root's absolute path name\n * ends in the slash character.\n * <li>Any string that conforms to these two rules is a valid path name.\n * </ul>\n *\n * <p>All of the methods that modify preferences data are permitted to operate\n * asynchronously; they may return immediately, and changes will eventually\n * propagate to the persistent backing store with an implementation-dependent\n * delay.  The <tt>flush</tt> method may be used to synchronously force\n * updates to the backing store.  Normal termination of the Java Virtual\n * Machine will <i>not</i> result in the loss of pending updates -- an explicit\n * <tt>flush</tt> invocation is <i>not</i> required upon termination to ensure\n * that pending updates are made persistent.\n *\n * <p>All of the methods that read preferences from a <tt>Preferences</tt>\n * object require the invoker to provide a default value.  The default value is\n * returned if no value has been previously set <i>or if the backing store is\n * unavailable</i>.  The intent is to allow applications to operate, albeit\n * with slightly degraded functionality, even if the backing store becomes\n * unavailable.  Several methods, like <tt>flush</tt>, have semantics that\n * prevent them from operating if the backing store is unavailable.  Ordinary\n * applications should have no need to invoke any of these methods, which can\n * be identified by the fact that they are declared to throw {@link\n * BackingStoreException}.\n *\n * <p>The methods in this class may be invoked concurrently by multiple threads\n * in a single JVM without the need for external synchronization, and the\n * results will be equivalent to some serial execution.  If this class is used\n * concurrently <i>by multiple JVMs</i> that store their preference data in\n * the same backing store, the data store will not be corrupted, but no\n * other guarantees are made concerning the consistency of the preference\n * data.\n *\n * <p>This class contains an export/import facility, allowing preferences\n * to be \"exported\" to an XML document, and XML documents representing\n * preferences to be \"imported\" back into the system.  This facility\n * may be used to back up all or part of a preference tree, and\n * subsequently restore from the backup.\n *\n * <p>The XML document has the following DOCTYPE declaration:\n * <pre>{@code\n * <!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM \"http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd\">\n * }</pre>\n * Note that the system URI (http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd) is\n * <i>not</i> accessed when exporting or importing preferences; it merely\n * serves as a string to uniquely identify the DTD, which is:\n * <pre>{@code\n *    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n *\n *    <!-- DTD for a Preferences tree. -->\n *\n *    <!-- The preferences element is at the root of an XML document\n *         representing a Preferences tree. -->\n *    <!ELEMENT preferences (root)>\n *\n *    <!-- The preferences element contains an optional version attribute,\n *          which specifies version of DTD. -->\n *    <!ATTLIST preferences EXTERNAL_XML_VERSION CDATA \"0.0\" >\n *\n *    <!-- The root element has a map representing the root's preferences\n *         (if any), and one node for each child of the root (if any). -->\n *    <!ELEMENT root (map, node*) >\n *\n *    <!-- Additionally, the root contains a type attribute, which\n *         specifies whether it's the system or user root. -->\n *    <!ATTLIST root\n *              type (system|user) #REQUIRED >\n *\n *    <!-- Each node has a map representing its preferences (if any),\n *         and one node for each child (if any). -->\n *    <!ELEMENT node (map, node*) >\n *\n *    <!-- Additionally, each node has a name attribute -->\n *    <!ATTLIST node\n *              name CDATA #REQUIRED >\n *\n *    <!-- A map represents the preferences stored at a node (if any). -->\n *    <!ELEMENT map (entry*) >\n *\n *    <!-- An entry represents a single preference, which is simply\n *          a key-value pair. -->\n *    <!ELEMENT entry EMPTY >\n *    <!ATTLIST entry\n *              key   CDATA #REQUIRED\n *              value CDATA #REQUIRED >\n * }</pre>\n *\n * Every <tt>Preferences</tt> implementation must have an associated {@link\n * PreferencesFactory} implementation.  Every Java(TM) SE implementation must provide\n * some means of specifying which <tt>PreferencesFactory</tt> implementation\n * is used to generate the root preferences nodes.  This allows the\n * administrator to replace the default preferences implementation with an\n * alternative implementation.\n *\n * <p>Implementation note: In Sun's JRE, the <tt>PreferencesFactory</tt>\n * implementation is located as follows:\n *\n * <ol>\n *\n * <li><p>If the system property\n * <tt>java.util.prefs.PreferencesFactory</tt> is defined, then it is\n * taken to be the fully-qualified name of a class implementing the\n * <tt>PreferencesFactory</tt> interface.  The class is loaded and\n * instantiated; if this process fails then an unspecified error is\n * thrown.</p></li>\n *\n * <li><p> If a <tt>PreferencesFactory</tt> implementation class file\n * has been installed in a jar file that is visible to the\n * {@link java.lang.ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader system class loader},\n * and that jar file contains a provider-configuration file named\n * <tt>java.util.prefs.PreferencesFactory</tt> in the resource\n * directory <tt>META-INF/services</tt>, then the first class name\n * specified in that file is taken.  If more than one such jar file is\n * provided, the first one found will be used.  The class is loaded\n * and instantiated; if this process fails then an unspecified error\n * is thrown.  </p></li>\n *\n * <li><p>Finally, if neither the above-mentioned system property nor\n * an extension jar file is provided, then the system-wide default\n * <tt>PreferencesFactory</tt> implementation for the underlying\n * platform is loaded and instantiated.</p></li>\n *\n * </ol>\n *\n * @author  Josh Bloch\n * @since   1.4\n ",
