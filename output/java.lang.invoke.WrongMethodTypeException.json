  "comment" : "\n * Thrown to indicate that code has attempted to call a method handle\n * via the wrong method type.  As with the bytecode representation of\n * normal Java method calls, method handle calls are strongly typed\n * to a specific type descriptor associated with a call site.\n * <p>\n * This exception may also be thrown when two method handles are\n * composed, and the system detects that their types cannot be\n * matched up correctly.  This amounts to an early evaluation\n * of the type mismatch, at method handle construction time,\n * instead of when the mismatched method handle is called.\n *\n * @author John Rose, JSR 292 EG\n * @since 1.7\n ",
