Each of the R,\n * G and B channels represent the intensities of the respective part of an RGB LED, if that is\n * supported. For devices that only support on or off lights, everything that's not off will turn\n * the light on. If the light is monochrome and only the brightness can be controlled, the RGB color\n * will be converted to only a brightness value and that will be used for the light's single\n * channel.\n *\n * @hide\n ",
