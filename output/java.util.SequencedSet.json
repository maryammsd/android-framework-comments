As such,\n * it can be thought of either as a {@code Set} that also has a well-defined\n * <a href=\"SequencedCollection.html#encounter\">encounter order</a>, or as a\n * {@code SequencedCollection} that also has unique elements.\n * <p>\n * This interface has the same requirements on the {@code equals} and {@code hashCode}\n * methods as defined by {@link Set#equals Set.equals} and {@link Set#hashCode Set.hashCode}.\n * Thus, a {@code Set} and a {@code SequencedSet} will compare equals if and only\n * if they have equal elements, irrespective of ordering.\n * <p>\n * {@code SequencedSet} defines the {@link #reversed} method, which provides a\n * reverse-ordered <a href=\"Collection.html#view\">view</a> of this set. The only difference\n * from the {@link SequencedCollection#reversed SequencedCollection.reversed} method is\n * that the return type of {@code SequencedSet.reversed} is {@code SequencedSet}.\n * <p>\n * This class is a member of the\n * <a href=\"{@docRoot}/java.base/java/util/package-summary.html#CollectionsFramework\">\n * Java Collections Framework</a>.\n *\n * @param <E> the type of elements in this sequenced set\n * @since 21\n ",
