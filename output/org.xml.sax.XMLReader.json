This interface allows an application to set and\n * query features and properties in the parser, to register\n * event handlers for document processing, and to initiate\n * a document parse.</p>\n *\n * <p>All SAX interfaces are assumed to be synchronous: the\n * {@link #parse parse} methods must not return until parsing\n * is complete, and readers must wait for an event-handler callback\n * to return before reporting the next event.</p>\n *\n * <p>This interface replaces the (now deprecated) SAX 1.0 {@link\n * org.xml.sax.Parser Parser} interface.  The XMLReader interface\n * contains two important enhancements over the old Parser\n * interface (as well as some minor ones):</p>\n *\n * <ol>\n * <li>it adds a standard way to query and set features and\n *  properties; and</li>\n * <li>it adds Namespace support, which is required for many\n *  higher-level XML standards.</li>\n * </ol>\n *\n * <p>There are adapters available to convert a SAX1 Parser to\n * a SAX2 XMLReader and vice-versa.</p>\n *\n * @since SAX 2.0\n * @author David Megginson\n * @version 2.0.1+ (sax2r3pre1)\n * @see org.xml.sax.XMLFilter\n * @see org.xml.sax.helpers.ParserAdapter\n * @see org.xml.sax.helpers.XMLReaderAdapter\n ",
