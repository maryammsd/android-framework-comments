  "comment" : "\n * The {@code CollationElementIterator} class is used as an iterator\n * to walk through each character of an international string. Use the iterator\n * to return the ordering priority of the positioned character. The ordering\n * priority of a character, which we refer to as a key, defines how a character\n * is collated in the given collation object.\n *\n * <p>\n * For example, consider the following in Spanish:\n * <blockquote>\n * <pre>\n * \"ca\" &rarr; the first key is key('c') and second key is key('a').\n * \"cha\" &rarr; the first key is key('ch') and second key is key('a').\n * </pre>\n * </blockquote>\n * And in German,\n * <blockquote>\n * <pre>\n * \"\\u00e4b\" &rarr; the first key is key('a'), the second key is key('e'), and\n * the third key is key('b').\n * </pre>\n * </blockquote>\n * The key of a character is an integer composed of primary order(short),\n * secondary order(byte), and tertiary order(byte). Java strictly defines\n * the size and signedness of its primitive data types. Therefore, the static\n * functions {@code primaryOrder}, {@code secondaryOrder}, and\n * {@code tertiaryOrder} return {@code int}, {@code short},\n * and {@code short} respectively to ensure the correctness of the key\n * value.\n *\n * <p>\n * Example of the iterator usage,\n * <blockquote>\n * <pre>\n *\n *  String testString = \"This is a test\";\n *  Collator col = Collator.getInstance();\n *  if (col instanceof RuleBasedCollator) {\n *      RuleBasedCollator ruleBasedCollator = (RuleBasedCollator)col;\n *      CollationElementIterator collationElementIterator = ruleBasedCollator.getCollationElementIterator(testString);\n *      int primaryOrder = CollationElementIterator.primaryOrder(collationElementIterator.next());\n *          :\n *  }\n * </pre>\n * </blockquote>\n *\n * <p>\n * {@code CollationElementIterator.next} returns the collation order\n * of the next character. A collation order consists of primary order,\n * secondary order and tertiary order. The data type of the collation\n * order is <strong>int</strong>. The first 16 bits of a collation order\n * is its primary order; the next 8 bits is the secondary order and the\n * last 8 bits is the tertiary order.\n *\n * <p><b>Note:</b> {@code CollationElementIterator} is a part of\n * {@code RuleBasedCollator} implementation. It is only usable\n * with {@code RuleBasedCollator} instances.\n *\n * @see                Collator\n * @see                RuleBasedCollator\n * @author             Helena Shih, Laura Werner, Richard Gillam\n * @since 1.1\n ",
