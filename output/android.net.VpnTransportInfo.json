On some networks, this\n     * can become extremely expensive in terms of battery. The system knows to send\n     * these keepalive packets only when necessary, i.e. when there are long-lived\n     * TCP connections opened over the VPN, meaning on these networks establishing\n     * a long-lived TCP connection will have a very noticeable impact on battery\n     * life.\n     *\n     * VPNs can be bypassable or not. When the VPN is not bypassable, the user has\n     * expressed explicit intent to have no connection outside of the VPN, so even\n     * privileged apps with permission to bypass non-bypassable VPNs should not do\n     * so. See {@link #isBypassable()}.\n     * For bypassable VPNs however, the user expects apps choose reasonable tradeoffs\n     * about whether they use the VPN.\n     *\n     * Components that establish long-lived, encrypted TCP connections are encouraged\n     * to look up this value to decide whether to open their connection over a VPN\n     * or to bypass it. While VPNs do not typically provide privacy or security\n     * benefits to encrypted connections, the user generally still expects the\n     * connections to choose to use the VPN by default, but also do not expect this\n     * comes at the price of drastically reduced battery life. This method provides\n     * a hint about whether the battery cost of opening such a connection is high.\n     ",
