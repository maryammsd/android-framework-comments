  "comment" : "\n * The subclass of {@link SQLException} is thrown when one or more client info properties\n * could not be set on a <code>Connection</code>.  In addition to the information provided\n * by <code>SQLException</code>, a <code>SQLClientInfoException</code> provides a list of client info\n * properties that were not set.\n *\n * Some databases do not allow multiple client info properties to be set\n * atomically.  For those databases, it is possible that some of the client\n * info properties had been set even though the <code>Connection.setClientInfo</code>\n * method threw an exception.  An application can use the <code>getFailedProperties </code>\n * method to retrieve a list of client info properties that were not set.  The\n * properties are identified by passing a\n * <code>Map&lt;String,ClientInfoStatus&gt;</code> to\n * the appropriate <code>SQLClientInfoException</code> constructor.\n * <p>\n * @see ClientInfoStatus\n * @see Connection#setClientInfo\n * @since 1.6\n ",
