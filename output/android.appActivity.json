  "comment" : "\n * An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do.  Almost all\n * activities interact with the user, so the Activity class takes care of\n * creating a window for you in which you can place your UI with\n * {@link #setContentView}.  While activities are often presented to the user\n * as full-screen windows, they can also be used in other ways: as floating\n * windows (via a theme with {@link android.R.attr#windowIsFloating} set),\n * <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/multi-window\">\n * Multi-Window mode</a> or embedded into other windows.\n *\n * There are two methods almost all subclasses of Activity will implement:\n *\n * <ul>\n *     <li> {@link #onCreate} is where you initialize your activity.  Most\n *     importantly, here you will usually call {@link #setContentView(int)}\n *     with a layout resource defining your UI, and using {@link #findViewById}\n *     to retrieve the widgets in that UI that you need to interact with\n *     programmatically.\n *\n *     <li> {@link #onPause} is where you deal with the user pausing active\n *     interaction with the activity. Any changes made by the user should at\n *     this point be committed (usually to the\n *     {@link android.content.ContentProvider} holding the data). In this\n *     state the activity is still visible on screen.\n * </ul>\n *\n * <p>To be of use with {@link android.content.Context#startActivity Context.startActivity()}, all\n * activity classes must have a corresponding\n * {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestActivity &lt;activity&gt;}\n * declaration in their package's <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>.</p>\n *\n * <p>Topics covered here:\n * <ol>\n * <li><a href=\"#Fragments\">Fragments</a>\n * <li><a href=\"#ActivityLifecycle\">Activity Lifecycle</a>\n * <li><a href=\"#ConfigurationChanges\">Configuration Changes</a>\n * <li><a href=\"#StartingActivities\">Starting Activities and Getting Results</a>\n * <li><a href=\"#SavingPersistentState\">Saving Persistent State</a>\n * <li><a href=\"#Permissions\">Permissions</a>\n * <li><a href=\"#ProcessLifecycle\">Process Lifecycle</a>\n * </ol>\n *\n * <div class=\"special reference\">\n * <h3>Developer Guides</h3>\n * <p>The Activity class is an important part of an application's overall lifecycle,\n * and the way activities are launched and put together is a fundamental\n * part of the platform's application model.

When a new activity is started, it is usually placed on the top of the\n * current stack and becomes the running activity -- the previous activity always remains\n * below it in the stack, and will not come to the foreground again until\n * the new activity exits. There can be one or multiple activity stacks visible\n * on screen.</p>\n *\n * <p>An activity has essentially four states:</p>\n * <ul>\n *     <li>If an activity is in the foreground of the screen (at the highest position of the topmost\n *         stack), it is <em>active</em> or <em>running</em>. This is usually the activity that the\n *         user is currently interacting with.</li>\n *     <li>If an activity has lost focus but is still presented to the user, it is <em>visible</em>.\n *         It is possible if a new non-full-sized or transparent activity has focus on top of your\n *         activity, another activity has higher position in multi-window mode, or the activity\n *         itself is not focusable in current windowing mode. Such activity is completely alive (it\n *         maintains all state and member information and remains attached to the window manager).\n *     <li>If an activity is completely obscured by another activity,\n *         it is <em>stopped</em> or <em>hidden</em>. It still retains all state and member\n *         information, however, it is no longer visible to the user so its window is hidden\n *         and it will often be killed by the system when memory is needed elsewhere.</li>\n *     <li>The system can drop the activity from memory by either asking it to finish,\n *         or simply killing its process, making it <em>destroyed</em>. When it is displayed again\n *         to the user, it must be completely restarted and restored to its previous state.</li>\n * </ul>\n *\n * <p>The following diagram shows the important state paths of an Activity.\n * The square rectangles represent callback methods you can implement to\n * perform operations when the Activity moves between states.  The colored\n * ovals are major states the Activity can be in.</p>\n *\n * <p><img src=\"../../../images/activity_lifecycle.png\"\n *      alt=\"State diagram for an Android Activity Lifecycle.\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n *\n * <p>There are three key loops you may be interested in monitoring within your\n * activity:\n *\n * <ul>\n * <li>The <b>entire lifetime</b> of an activity happens between the first call\n * to {@link android.app.Activity#onCreate} through to a single final call\n * to {@link android.app.Activity#onDestroy}.  An activity will do all setup\n * of \"global\" state in onCreate(), and release all remaining resources in\n * onDestroy().  For example, if it has a thread running in the background\n * to download data from the network, it may create that thread in onCreate()\n * and then stop the thread in onDestroy().\n *\n * <li>The <b>visible lifetime</b> of an activity happens between a call to\n * {@link android.app.Activity#onStart} until a corresponding call to\n * {@link android.app.Activity#onStop}.  During this time the user can see the\n * activity on-screen, though it may not be in the foreground and interacting\n * with the user.  Between these two methods you can maintain resources that\n * are needed to show the activity to the user.  For example, you can register\n * a {@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver} in onStart() to monitor for changes\n * that impact your UI, and unregister it in onStop() when the user no\n * longer sees what you are displaying.  The onStart() and onStop() methods\n * can be called multiple times, as the activity becomes visible and hidden\n * to the user.\n *\n * <li>The <b>foreground lifetime</b> of an activity happens between a call to\n * {@link android.app.Activity#onResume} until a corresponding call to\n * {@link android.app.Activity#onPause}.  During this time the activity is\n * in visible, active and interacting with the user.  An activity\n * can frequently go between the resumed and paused states -- for example when\n * the device goes to sleep, when an activity result is delivered, when a new\n * intent is delivered -- so the code in these methods should be fairly\n * lightweight.\n * </ul>\n *\n * <p>The entire lifecycle of an activity is defined by the following\n * Activity methods.  All of these are hooks that you can override\n * to do appropriate work when the activity changes state.  All\n * activities will implement {@link android.app.Activity#onCreate}\n * to do their initial setup; many will also implement\n * {@link android.app.Activity#onPause} to commit changes to data and\n * prepare to pause interacting with the user, and {@link android.app.Activity#onStop}\n * to handle no longer being visible on screen. You should always\n * call up to your superclass when implementing these methods.</p>\n *\n * </p>\n * <pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n * public class Activity extends ApplicationContext {\n *     protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState);\n *\n *     protected void onStart();\n *\n *     protected void onRestart();\n *\n *     protected void onResume();\n *\n *     protected void onPause();\n *\n *     protected void onStop();\n *\n *     protected void onDestroy();\n * }\n * </pre>\n *\n * <p>In general the movement through an activity's lifecycle looks like\n * this:</p>\n *\n * <table border=\"2\" width=\"85%\" align=\"center\" frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"rows\">\n *     <colgroup align=\"left\" span=\"3\" />\n *     <colgroup align=\"left\" />\n *     <colgroup align=\"center\" />\n *     <colgroup align=\"center\" />\n *\n *     <thead>\n *     <tr><th colspan=\"3\">Method</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Killable?</th> <th>Next</th></tr>\n *     </thead>\n *\n *     <tbody>\n *     <tr><td colspan=\"3\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\">{@link android.app.Activity#onCreate onCreate()}</td>\n *         <td>Called when the activity is first created.\n *             This is where you should do all of your normal static set up:\n *             create views, bind data to lists, etc.  This method also\n *             provides you with a Bundle containing the activity's previously\n *             frozen state, if there was one.\n *             <p>Always followed by <code>onStart()</code>.</td>\n *         <td align=\"center\">No</td>\n *         <td align=\"center\"><code>onStart()</code></td>\n *     </tr>\n *\n *     <tr><td rowspan=\"5\" style=\"border-left: none; border-right: none;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n *         <td colspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\">{@link android.app.Activity#onRestart onRestart()}</td>\n *         <td>Called after your activity has been stopped, prior to it being\n *             started again.\n *             <p>Always followed by <code>onStart()</code></td>\n *         <td align=\"center\">No</td>\n *         <td align=\"center\"><code>onStart()</code></td>\n *     </tr>\n *\n *     <tr><td colspan=\"2\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\">{@link android.app.Activity#onStart onStart()}</td>\n *         <td>Called when the activity is becoming visible to the user.\n *             <p>Followed by <code>onResume()</code> if the activity comes\n *             to the foreground, or <code>onStop()</code> if it becomes hidden.</td>\n *         <td align=\"center\">No</td>\n *         <td align=\"center\"><code>onResume()</code> or <code>onStop()</code></td>\n *     </tr>\n *\n *     <tr><td rowspan=\"2\" style=\"border-left: none;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\n *         <td align=\"left\" border=\"0\">{@link android.app.Activity#onResume onResume()}</td>\n *         <td>Called when the activity will start\n *             interacting with the user.

Because of this, you should use the\n * {@link #onPause} method to write any persistent data (such as user edits)\n * to storage.  In addition, the method\n * {@link #onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)} is called before placing the activity\n * in such a background state, allowing you to save away any dynamic instance\n * state in your activity into the given Bundle, to be later received in\n * {@link #onCreate} if the activity needs to be re-created.\n * See the <a href=\"#ProcessLifecycle\">Process Lifecycle</a>\n * section for more information on how the lifecycle of a process is tied\n * to the activities it is hosting.  Note that it is important to save\n * persistent data in {@link #onPause} instead of {@link #onSaveInstanceState}\n * because the latter is not part of the lifecycle callbacks, so will not\n * be called in every situation as described in its documentation.</p>\n *\n * <p class=\"note\">Be aware that these semantics will change slightly between\n * applications targeting platforms starting with {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#HONEYCOMB}\n * vs. those targeting prior platforms.  Starting with Honeycomb, an application\n * is not in the killable state until its {@link #onStop} has returned.  This\n * impacts when {@link #onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)} may be called (it may be\n * safely called after {@link #onPause()}) and allows an application to safely\n * wait until {@link #onStop()} to save persistent state.</p>\n *\n * <p class=\"note\">For applications targeting platforms starting with\n * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#P} {@link #onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)}\n * will always be called after {@link #onStop}, so an application may safely\n * perform fragment transactions in {@link #onStop} and will be able to save\n * persistent state later.</p>\n *\n * <p>For those methods that are not marked as being killable, the activity's\n * process will not be killed by the system starting from the time the method\n * is called and continuing after it returns.  Thus an activity is in the killable\n * state, for example, between after <code>onStop()</code> to the start of\n * <code>onResume()</code>. Keep in mind that under extreme memory pressure the\n * system can kill the application process at any time.</p>\n *\n * <a name=\"ConfigurationChanges\"></a>\n * <h3>Configuration Changes</h3>\n *\n * <p>If the configuration of the device (as defined by the\n * {@link Configuration Resources.Configuration} class) changes,\n * then anything displaying a user interface will need to update to match that\n * configuration.  Because Activity is the primary mechanism for interacting\n * with the user, it includes special support for handling configuration\n * changes.</p>\n *\n * <p>Unless you specify otherwise, a configuration change (such as a change\n * in screen orientation, language, input devices, etc) will cause your\n * current activity to be <em>destroyed</em>, going through the normal activity\n * lifecycle process of {@link #onPause},\n * {@link #onStop}, and {@link #onDestroy} as appropriate.  If the activity\n * had been in the foreground or visible to the user, once {@link #onDestroy} is\n * called in that instance then a new instance of the activity will be\n * created, with whatever savedInstanceState the previous instance had generated\n * from {@link #onSaveInstanceState}.</p>\n *\n * <p>This is done because any application resource,\n * including layout files, can change based on any configuration value.  Thus\n * the only safe way to handle a configuration change is to re-retrieve all\n * resources, including layouts, drawables, and strings.  Because activities\n * must already know how to save their state and re-create themselves from\n * that state, this is a convenient way to have an activity restart itself\n * with a new configuration.</p>\n *\n * <p>In some special cases, you may want to bypass restarting of your\n * activity based on one or more types of configuration changes.  This is\n * done with the {@link android.R.attr#configChanges android:configChanges}\n * attribute in its manifest.  For any types of configuration changes you say\n * that you handle there, you will receive a call to your current activity's\n * {@link #onConfigurationChanged} method instead of being restarted.  If\n * a configuration change involves any that you do not handle, however, the\n * activity will still be restarted and {@link #onConfigurationChanged}\n * will not be called.</p>\n *\n * <a name=\"StartingActivities\"></a>\n * <h3>Starting Activities and Getting Results</h3>\n *\n * <p>The {@link android.app.Activity#startActivity}\n * method is used to start a\n * new activity, which will be placed at the top of the activity stack.  It\n * takes a single argument, an {@link android.content.Intent Intent},\n * which describes the activity\n * to be executed.</p>\n *\n * <p>Sometimes you want to get a result back from an activity when it\n * ends.  For example, you may start an activity that lets the user pick\n * a person in a list of contacts; when it ends, it returns the person\n * that was selected.  To do this, you call the\n * {@link android.app.Activity#startActivityForResult(Intent, int)}\n * version with a second integer parameter identifying the call.  The result\n * will come back through your {@link android.app.Activity#onActivityResult}\n * method.</p>\n *\n * <p>When an activity exits, it can call\n * {@link android.app.Activity#setResult(int)}\n * to return data back to its parent.  It must always supply a result code,\n * which can be the standard results RESULT_CANCELED, RESULT_OK, or any\n * custom values starting at RESULT_FIRST_USER.  In addition, it can optionally\n * return back an Intent containing any additional data it wants.  All of this\n * information appears back on the\n * parent's <code>Activity.onActivityResult()</code>, along with the integer\n * identifier it originally supplied.</p>\n *\n * <p>If a child activity fails for any reason (such as crashing), the parent\n * activity will receive a result with the code RESULT_CANCELED.</p>\n *\n * <pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n * public class MyActivity extends Activity {\n *     ...\n *\n *     static final int PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST = 0;\n *\n *     public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {\n *         if (keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER) {\n *             // When the user center presses, let them pick a contact.\n *             startActivityForResult(\n *                 new Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK,\n *                 new Uri(\"content://contacts\")),\n *                 PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST);\n *            return true;\n *         }\n *         return false;\n *     }\n *\n *     protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode,\n *             Intent data) {\n *         if (requestCode == PICK_CONTACT_REQUEST) {\n *             if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {\n *                 // A contact was picked.

That is, any edits a user makes are effectively\n * made immediately without requiring an additional confirmation step.\n * Supporting this model is generally a simple matter of following two rules:</p>\n *\n * <ul>\n *     <li> <p>When creating a new document, the backing database entry or file for\n *             it is created immediately.  For example, if the user chooses to write\n *             a new email, a new entry for that email is created as soon as they\n *             start entering data, so that if they go to any other activity after\n *             that point this email will now appear in the list of drafts.</p>\n *     <li> <p>When an activity's <code>onPause()</code> method is called, it should\n *             commit to the backing content provider or file any changes the user\n *             has made.  This ensures that those changes will be seen by any other\n *             activity that is about to run.  You will probably want to commit\n *             your data even more aggressively at key times during your\n *             activity's lifecycle: for example before starting a new\n *             activity, before finishing your own activity, when the user\n *             switches between input fields, etc.</p>\n * </ul>\n *\n * <p>This model is designed to prevent data loss when a user is navigating\n * between activities, and allows the system to safely kill an activity (because\n * system resources are needed somewhere else) at any time after it has been\n * stopped (or paused on platform versions before {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#HONEYCOMB}).\n * Note this implies that the user pressing BACK from your activity does <em>not</em>\n * mean \"cancel\" -- it means to leave the activity with its current contents\n * saved away.  Canceling edits in an activity must be provided through\n * some other mechanism, such as an explicit \"revert\" or \"undo\" option.</p>\n *\n * <p>See the {@linkplain android.content.ContentProvider content package} for\n * more information about content providers.  These are a key aspect of how\n * different activities invoke and propagate data between themselves.</p>\n *\n * <p>The Activity class also provides an API for managing internal persistent state\n * associated with an activity.  This can be used, for example, to remember\n * the user's preferred initial display in a calendar (day view or week view)\n * or the user's default home page in a web browser.</p>\n *\n * <p>Activity persistent state is managed\n * with the method {@link #getPreferences},\n * allowing you to retrieve and\n * modify a set of name/value pairs associated with the activity.  To use\n * preferences that are shared across multiple application components\n * (activities, receivers, services, providers), you can use the underlying\n * {@link Context#getSharedPreferences Context.getSharedPreferences()} method\n * to retrieve a preferences\n * object stored under a specific name.\n * (Note that it is not possible to share settings data across application\n * packages -- for that you will need a content provider.)</p>\n *\n * <p>Here is an excerpt from a calendar activity that stores the user's\n * preferred view mode in its persistent settings:</p>\n *\n * <pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n * public class CalendarActivity extends Activity {\n *     ...\n *\n *     static final int DAY_VIEW_MODE = 0;\n *     static final int WEEK_VIEW_MODE = 1;\n *\n *     private SharedPreferences mPrefs;\n *     private int mCurViewMode;\n *\n *     protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n *         super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n *\n *         SharedPreferences mPrefs = getSharedPreferences();\n *         mCurViewMode = mPrefs.getInt(\"view_mode\", DAY_VIEW_MODE);\n *     }\n *\n *     protected void onPause() {\n *         super.onPause();\n *\n *         SharedPreferences.Editor ed = mPrefs.edit();\n *         ed.putInt(\"view_mode\", mCurViewMode);\n *         ed.commit();\n *     }\n * }\n * </pre>\n *\n * <a name=\"Permissions\"></a>\n * <h3>Permissions</h3>\n *\n * <p>The ability to start a particular Activity can be enforced when it is\n * declared in its\n * manifest's {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestActivity &lt;activity&gt;}\n * tag.  By doing so, other applications will need to declare a corresponding\n * {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestUsesPermission &lt;uses-permission&gt;}\n * element in their own manifest to be able to start that activity.\n *\n * <p>When starting an Activity you can set {@link Intent#FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION\n * Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION} and/or {@link Intent#FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION\n * Intent.FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION} on the Intent.

As of\n * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#GINGERBREAD}, if the Activity\n * was already created and a new Intent is being delivered to\n * {@link #onNewIntent(Intent)}, any newly granted URI permissions will be added\n * to the existing ones it holds.\n *\n * <p>See the <a href=\"{@docRoot}guide/topics/security/security.html\">Security and Permissions</a>\n * document for more information on permissions and security in general.\n *\n * <a name=\"ProcessLifecycle\"></a>\n * <h3>Process Lifecycle</h3>\n *\n * <p>The Android system attempts to keep an application process around for as\n * long as possible, but eventually will need to remove old processes when\n * memory runs low. As described in <a href=\"#ActivityLifecycle\">Activity\n * Lifecycle</a>, the decision about which process to remove is intimately\n * tied to the state of the user's interaction with it. In general, there\n * are four states a process can be in based on the activities running in it,\n * listed here in order of importance. The system will kill less important\n * processes (the last ones) before it resorts to killing more important\n * processes (the first ones).\n *\n * <ol>\n * <li> <p>The <b>foreground activity</b> (the activity at the top of the screen\n * that the user is currently interacting with) is considered the most important.\n * Its process will only be killed as a last resort, if it uses more memory\n * than is available on the device.  Generally at this point the device has\n * reached a memory paging state, so this is required in order to keep the user\n * interface responsive.\n * <li> <p>A <b>visible activity</b> (an activity that is visible to the user\n * but not in the foreground, such as one sitting behind a foreground dialog\n * or next to other activities in multi-window mode)\n * is considered extremely important and will not be killed unless that is\n * required to keep the foreground activity running.\n * <li> <p>A <b>background activity</b> (an activity that is not visible to\n * the user and has been stopped) is no longer critical, so the system may\n * safely kill its process to reclaim memory for other foreground or\n * visible processes.  If its process needs to be killed, when the user navigates\n * back to the activity (making it visible on the screen again), its\n * {@link #onCreate} method will be called with the savedInstanceState it had previously\n * supplied in {@link #onSaveInstanceState} so that it can restart itself in the same\n * state as the user last left it.\n * <li> <p>An <b>empty process</b> is one hosting no activities or other\n * application components (such as {@link Service} or\n * {@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver} classes).  These are killed very\n * quickly by the system as memory becomes low.  For this reason, any\n * background operation you do outside of an activity must be executed in the\n * context of an activity BroadcastReceiver or Service to ensure that the system\n * knows it needs to keep your process around.\n * </ol>\n *\n * <p>Sometimes an Activity may need to do a long-running operation that exists\n * independently of the activity lifecycle itself.  An example may be a camera\n * application that allows you to upload a picture to a web site.  The upload\n * may take a long time, and the application should allow the user to leave\n * the application while it is executing.  To accomplish this, your Activity\n * should start a {@link Service} in which the upload takes place.  This allows\n * the system to properly prioritize your process (considering it to be more\n * important than other non-visible applications) for the duration of the\n * upload, independent of whether the original activity is paused, stopped,\n * or finished.\n ",
