The generic {@link\n * org.chromium.base.Callback} cannot be used because it is limited to a single argument.\n * Alternative approaches like encoding the two arguments into one string or one array of objects\n * with different types were considered, but their downside was both a lot of boilerplate (creating\n * the composed object in C++ and checking and decoding it in Java) and lack of clarity. This\n * 2-argument callback also adds a few code lines but it is clear and the compiler does the type\n * checking.\n ",
