Every instance of {@code UrlRequest} can be cast to an\n * instance of this class, as they are backed by the same implementation and hence perform\n * identically. Instances of this class are not meant for general use, but instead only to access\n * experimental features. Experimental features may be deprecated in the future. Use at your own\n * risk.\n *\n * {@hide for consistency with other experimental classes}\n *\n * @deprecated scheduled for deletion, don't use in new code.\n ",
