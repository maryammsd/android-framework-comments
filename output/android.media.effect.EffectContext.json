If your EGL context is\n * destroyed, the EffectContext becomes invalid and any effects bound to this context can no longer\n * be used. If you switch to another EGL context, you must create a new EffectContext. Each Effect\n * is bound to a single EffectContext, and can only be executed in that context.</p>\n ",
