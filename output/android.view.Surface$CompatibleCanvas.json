For example, the canvas returns 320x480 even if an app is running\n     * in WVGA high density.\n     * <li>Scales the matrix in setMatrix by the application scale, except if\n     * the matrix looks like obtained from getMatrix. This is a hack to handle\n     * the case that an application uses getMatrix to keep the original matrix,\n     * set matrix of its own, then set the original matrix back. There is no\n     * perfect solution that works for all cases, and there are a lot of cases\n     * that this model does not work, but we hope this works for many apps.\n     * </ul>\n     ",
