There can be many generations associated with threads\n     * using the barrier - due to the non-deterministic way the lock\n     * may be allocated to waiting threads - but only one of these\n     * can be active at a time (the one to which {@code count} applies)\n     * and all the rest are either broken or tripped.\n     * There need not be an active generation if there has been a break\n     * but no subsequent reset.\n     ",
