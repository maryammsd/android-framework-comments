All certification paths that are built and\n * returned using this algorithm are also validated according to the PKIX\n * certification path validation algorithm.\n *\n * <p>Instances of {@code PKIXCertPathBuilderResult} are returned by\n * the {@code build} method of {@code CertPathBuilder}\n * objects implementing the PKIX algorithm.\n *\n * <p>All {@code PKIXCertPathBuilderResult} objects contain the\n * certification path constructed by the build algorithm, the\n * valid policy tree and subject public key resulting from the build\n * algorithm, and a {@code TrustAnchor} describing the certification\n * authority (CA) that served as a trust anchor for the certification path.\n * <p>\n * <b>Concurrent Access</b>\n * <p>\n * Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not\n * thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single\n * object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and\n * provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating\n * separate objects need not synchronize.\n *\n * @see CertPathBuilderResult\n *\n * @since       1.4\n * @author      Anne Anderson\n ",
