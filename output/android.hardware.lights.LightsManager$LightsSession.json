A lights session is AutoCloseable that will get closed when leaving the\n     * session context.\n     *\n     * <p>Multiple sessions can make lights requests which contains same light.

When\n     * the session hold the current light request closed, LightsManager implementation will choose\n     * another live session to honor its lights requests.\n     ",
