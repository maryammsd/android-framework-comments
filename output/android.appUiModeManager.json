These services\n * allow applications to control UI modes of the device.\n * It provides functionality to disable the car mode and it gives access to the\n * night mode settings.\n * \n * <p>These facilities are built on top of the underlying\n * {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_DOCK_EVENT} broadcasts that are sent when the user\n * physical places the device into and out of a dock.  When that happens,\n * the UiModeManager switches the system {@link android.content.res.Configuration}\n * to the appropriate UI mode, sends broadcasts about the mode switch, and\n * starts the corresponding mode activity if appropriate.  See the\n * broadcasts {@link #ACTION_ENTER_CAR_MODE} and\n * {@link #ACTION_ENTER_DESK_MODE} for more information.\n * \n * <p>In addition, the user may manually switch the system to car mode without\n * physically being in a dock.  While in car mode -- whether by manual action\n * from the user or being physically placed in a dock -- a notification is\n * displayed allowing the user to exit dock mode.  Thus the dock mode\n * represented here may be different than the current state of the underlying\n * dock event broadcast.\n ",
