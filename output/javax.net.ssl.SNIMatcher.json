  "comment" : "\n * Instances of this class represent a matcher that performs match\n * operations on an {@link SNIServerName} instance.\n * <P>\n * Servers can use Server Name Indication (SNI) information to decide if\n * specific {@link SSLSocket} or {@link SSLEngine} instances should accept\n * a connection.  For example, when multiple \"virtual\" or \"name-based\"\n * servers are hosted on a single underlying network address, the server\n * application can use SNI information to determine whether this server is\n * the exact server that the client wants to access.  Instances of this\n * class can be used by a server to verify the acceptable server names of\n * a particular type, such as host names.\n * <P>\n * {@code SNIMatcher} objects are immutable.  Subclasses should not provide\n * methods that can change the state of an instance once it has been created.\n *\n * @see SNIServerName\n * @see SNIHostName\n * @see SSLParameters#getSNIMatchers()\n * @see SSLParameters#setSNIMatchers(Collection)\n *\n * @since 1.8\n ",
