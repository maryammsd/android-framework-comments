This exception may be thrown in two cases:\n *\n * <ul>\n *   <li>An attempt was made to read an object when the next element in the\n *       stream is primitive data.  In this case, the OptionalDataException's\n *       length field is set to the number of bytes of primitive data\n *       immediately readable from the stream, and the eof field is set to\n *       false.\n *\n *   <li>An attempt was made to read past the end of data consumable by a\n *       class-defined readObject or readExternal method.  In this case, the\n *       OptionalDataException's eof field is set to true, and the length field\n *       is set to 0.\n * </ul>\n *\n * @since   1.1\n ",
