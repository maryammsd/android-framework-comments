Filters can modify a stream of\n * events as they pass on to the final application.</p>\n *\n * <p>The XMLFilterImpl helper class provides a convenient base\n * for creating SAX2 filters, by passing on all {@link org.xml.sax.EntityResolver\n * EntityResolver}, {@link org.xml.sax.DTDHandler DTDHandler},\n * {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler ContentHandler} and {@link org.xml.sax.ErrorHandler\n * ErrorHandler} events automatically.</p>\n *\n * @since SAX 2.0\n * @author David Megginson\n * @version 2.0.1 (sax2r2)\n * @see org.xml.sax.helpers.XMLFilterImpl\n ",
