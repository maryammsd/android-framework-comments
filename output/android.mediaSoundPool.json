  "comment" : "\n * The SoundPool class manages and plays audio resources for applications.\n *\n * <p>A SoundPool is a collection of samples that can be loaded into memory\n * from a resource inside the APK or from a file in the file system. The\n * SoundPool library uses the MediaPlayer service to decode the audio\n * into a raw 16-bit PCM mono or stereo stream. This allows applications\n * to ship with compressed streams without having to suffer the CPU load\n * and latency of decompressing during playback.</p>\n *\n * <p>In addition to low-latency playback, SoundPool can also manage the number\n * of audio streams being rendered at once. When the SoundPool object is\n * constructed, the maxStreams parameter sets the maximum number of streams\n * that can be played at a time from this single SoundPool. SoundPool tracks\n * the number of active streams. If the maximum number of streams is exceeded,\n * SoundPool will automatically stop a previously playing stream based first\n * on priority and then by age within that priority. Limiting the maximum\n * number of streams helps to cap CPU loading and reducing the likelihood that\n * audio mixing will impact visuals or UI performance.</p>\n *\n * <p>Sounds can be looped by setting a non-zero loop value. A value of -1\n * causes the sound to loop forever. In this case, the application must\n * explicitly call the stop() function to stop the sound. Any other non-zero\n * value will cause the sound to repeat the specified number of times, e.g.\n * a value of 3 causes the sound to play a total of 4 times.</p>\n *\n * <p>The playback rate can also be changed. A playback rate of 1.0 causes\n * the sound to play at its original frequency (resampled, if necessary,\n * to the hardware output frequency). A playback rate of 2.0 causes the\n * sound to play at twice its original frequency, and a playback rate of\n * 0.5 causes it to play at half its original frequency. The playback\n * rate range is 0.5 to 2.0.</p>\n *\n * <p>Priority runs low to high, i.e. higher numbers are higher priority.\n * Priority is used when a call to play() would cause the number of active\n * streams to exceed the value established by the maxStreams parameter when\n * the SoundPool was created. In this case, the stream allocator will stop\n * the lowest priority stream. If there are multiple streams with the same\n * low priority, it will choose the oldest stream to stop. In the case\n * where the priority of the new stream is lower than all the active\n * streams, the new sound will not play and the play() function will return\n * a streamID of zero.</p>\n *\n * <p>Let's examine a typical use case: A game consists of several levels of\n * play. For each level, there is a set of unique sounds that are used only\n * by that level. In this case, the game logic should create a new SoundPool\n * object when the first level is loaded. The level data itself might contain\n * the list of sounds to be used by this level. The loading logic iterates\n * through the list of sounds calling the appropriate SoundPool.load()\n * function. This should typically be done early in the process to allow time\n * for decompressing the audio to raw PCM format before they are needed for\n * playback.</p>\n *\n * <p>Once the sounds are loaded and play has started, the application can\n * trigger sounds by calling SoundPool.play(). Playing streams can be\n * paused or resumed, and the application can also alter the pitch by\n * adjusting the playback rate in real-time for doppler or synthesis\n * effects.</p>\n *\n * <p>Note that since streams can be stopped due to resource constraints, the\n * streamID is a reference to a particular instance of a stream. If the stream\n * is stopped to allow a higher priority stream to play, the stream is no\n * longer valid. However, the application is allowed to call methods on\n * the streamID without error. This may help simplify program logic since\n * the application need not concern itself with the stream lifecycle.</p>\n *\n * <p>In our example, when the player has completed the level, the game\n * logic should call SoundPool.release() to release all the native resources\n * in use and then set the SoundPool reference to null. If the player starts\n * another level, a new SoundPool is created, sounds are loaded, and play\n * resumes.</p>\n ",
