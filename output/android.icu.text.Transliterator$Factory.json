When invoked, the\n     * factory object will be passed the ID being instantiated.  This\n     * makes it possible to register one factory method to more than\n     * one ID, or for a factory method to parameterize its result\n     * based on the variant.\n     * @hide Only a subset of ICU is exposed in Android\n     ",
