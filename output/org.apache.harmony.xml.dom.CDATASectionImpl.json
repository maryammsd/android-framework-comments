The class is used internally only, thus only notable members that\n * are not in the original interface are documented (the W3C docs are quite\n * extensive). Hope that's ok.\n * <p>\n * Some of the fields may have package visibility, so other classes belonging to\n * the DOM implementation can easily access them while maintaining the DOM tree\n * structure.\n ",
