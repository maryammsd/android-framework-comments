Such keys are permanently and irreversibly invalidated once the secure lock screen\n * is disabled (i.e., reconfigured to None, Swipe or other mode which does not authenticate the\n * user) or when the secure lock screen is forcibly reset (e.g., by Device Admin). Additionally,\n * keys configured to require user authentication to take place for every of the keys, are also\n * permanently invalidated once a new fingerprint is enrolled or once no more fingerprints are\n * enrolled.\n ",
