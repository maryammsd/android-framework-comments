  "comment" : "\n * VpnService is a base class for applications to extend and build their\n * own VPN solutions. In general, it creates a virtual network interface,\n * configures addresses and routing rules, and returns a file descriptor\n * to the application. Each read from the descriptor retrieves an outgoing\n * packet which was routed to the interface. Each write to the descriptor\n * injects an incoming packet just like it was received from the interface.\n * The interface is running on Internet Protocol (IP), so packets are\n * always started with IP headers. The application then completes a VPN\n * connection by processing and exchanging packets with the remote server\n * over a tunnel.\n *\n * <p>Letting applications intercept packets raises huge security concerns.\n * A VPN application can easily break the network. Besides, two of them may\n * conflict with each other. The system takes several actions to address\n * these issues. Here are some key points:\n * <ul>\n *   <li>User action is required the first time an application creates a VPN\n *       connection.</li>\n *   <li>There can be only one VPN connection running at the same time. The\n *       existing interface is deactivated when a new one is created.</li>\n *   <li>A system-managed notification is shown during the lifetime of a\n *       VPN connection.</li>\n *   <li>A system-managed dialog gives the information of the current VPN\n *       connection. It also provides a button to disconnect.</li>\n *   <li>The network is restored automatically when the file descriptor is\n *       closed. It also covers the cases when a VPN application is crashed\n *       or killed by the system.</li>\n * </ul>\n *\n * <p>There are two primary methods in this class: {@link #prepare} and\n * {@link Builder#establish}. The former deals with user action and stops\n * the VPN connection created by another application. The latter creates\n * a VPN interface using the parameters supplied to the {@link Builder}.\n * An application must call {@link #prepare} to grant the right to use\n * other methods in this class, and the right can be revoked at any time.\n * Here are the general steps to create a VPN connection:\n * <ol>\n *   <li>When the user presses the button to connect, call {@link #prepare}\n *       and launch the returned intent, if non-null.</li>\n *   <li>When the application becomes prepared, start the service.</li>\n *   <li>Create a tunnel to the remote server and negotiate the network\n *       parameters for the VPN connection.</li>\n *   <li>Supply those parameters to a {@link Builder} and create a VPN\n *       interface by calling {@link Builder#establish}.</li>\n *   <li>Process and exchange packets between the tunnel and the returned\n *       file descriptor.</li>\n *   <li>When {@link #onRevoke} is invoked, close the file descriptor and\n *       shut down the tunnel gracefully.</li>\n * </ol>\n *\n * <p>Services extending this class need to be declared with an appropriate\n * permission and intent filter. Their access must be secured by\n * {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_VPN_SERVICE} permission, and\n * their intent filter must match {@link #SERVICE_INTERFACE} action. Here\n * is an example of declaring a VPN service in {@code AndroidManifest.xml}:\n * <pre>\n * &lt;service android:name=\".ExampleVpnService\"\n *         android:permission=\"android.permission.BIND_VPN_SERVICE\"&gt;\n *     &lt;intent-filter&gt;\n *         &lt;action android:name=\"android.net.VpnService\"/&gt;\n *     &lt;/intent-filter&gt;\n * &lt;/service&gt;</pre>\n *\n * <p> The Android system starts a VPN in the background by calling\n * {@link android.content.Context#startService startService()}. In Android 8.0\n * (API level 26) and higher, the system places VPN apps on the temporary\n * whitelist for a short period so the app can start in the background. The VPN\n * app must promote itself to the foreground after it's launched or the system\n * will shut down the app.\n *\n * <h3>Developer's guide</h3>\n *\n * <p>To learn more about developing VPN apps, read the\n * <a href=\"{@docRoot}guide/topics/connectivity/vpn\">VPN developer's guide</a>.\n *\n * @see Builder\n ",
