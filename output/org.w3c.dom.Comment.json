Note that this is\n * the definition of a comment in XML, and, in practice, HTML, although some\n * HTML tools may implement the full SGML comment structure.\n * <p> No lexical check is done on the content of a comment and it is\n * therefore possible to have the character sequence <code>\"--\"</code>\n * (double-hyphen) in the content, which is illegal in a comment per section\n * 2.5 of [<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204'>XML 1.0</a>]. The\n * presence of this character sequence must generate a fatal error during\n * serialization.\n * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification</a>.\n ",
