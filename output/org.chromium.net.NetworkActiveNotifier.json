  "comment" : "\n * Triggers updates to the underlying network state in Chrome alongside NetworkChangeNotifier.\n *\n * Differently from NetworkChangeNotifier, this handles default network active type of\n * notifications. These are handled separately for two main reasons:\n * 1. They are more expensive to listen to and currently only used by bidi streams connection status\n *    check. Hence, we only enable them when they are actually required.\n * 2. The default network active value is not cacheable, what observers are interested in is the\n *    event itself (usually to send out packets which were being batched). For this reason the\n *    architecture of NetworkChangeNotifier doesn't make much sense for this notification type.\n *\n * Note: ConnectivityManager.OnNetworkActiveListener has been introduced in Android API level 21, so\n * loading this class will fail on older Android versions (no sdk checks are needed for this\n * reason).\n ",
