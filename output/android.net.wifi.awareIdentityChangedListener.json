  "comment" : "\n * Base class for a listener which is called with the MAC address of the Aware interface whenever\n * it is changed. Change may be due to device joining a cluster, starting a cluster, or discovery\n * interface change (addresses are randomized at regular intervals). The implication is that\n * peers you've been communicating with may no longer recognize you and you need to re-establish\n * your identity - e.g. by starting a discovery session. This actual MAC address of the\n * interface may also be useful if the application uses alternative (non-Aware) discovery but needs\n * to set up a Aware connection. The provided Aware discovery interface MAC address can then be used\n * in {@link WifiAwareSession#createNetworkSpecifierOpen(int, byte[])} or\n * {@link WifiAwareSession#createNetworkSpecifierPassphrase(int, byte[], String)}.\n ",
