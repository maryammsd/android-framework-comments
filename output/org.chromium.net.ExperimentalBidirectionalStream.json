Every instance of {@code\n * BidirectionalStream} can be cast to an instance of this class, as they are backed by the same\n * implementation and hence perform identically. Instances of this class are not meant for general\n * use, but instead only to access experimental features. Experimental features may be deprecated in\n * the future. Use at your own risk.\n *\n * <p>{@hide for consistency with other experimental classes}\n *\n * @deprecated scheduled for deletion, don't use in new code.\n ",
