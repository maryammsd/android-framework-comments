  "comment" : "\n * The exception that is thrown when an application exposes a {@code file://}\n * {@link android.net.Uri} to another app.\n * <p>\n * This exposure is discouraged since the receiving app may not have access to\n * the shared path. For example, the receiving app may not have requested the\n * {@link android.Manifest.permission#READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} runtime permission,\n * or the platform may be sharing the {@link android.net.Uri} across user\n * profile boundaries.\n * <p>\n * Instead, apps should use {@code content://} Uris so the platform can extend\n * temporary permission for the receiving app to access the resource.\n * <p>\n * This is only thrown for applications targeting {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#N}\n * or higher. Applications targeting earlier SDK versions are allowed to share\n * {@code file://} {@link android.net.Uri}, but it's strongly discouraged.\n *\n * @see androidx.core.content.FileProvider\n * @see Intent#FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION\n ",
