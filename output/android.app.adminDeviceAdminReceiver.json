  "comment" : "\n * Base class for implementing a device administration component.  This\n * class provides a convenience for interpreting the raw intent actions\n * that are sent by the system.\n *\n * <p>The callback methods, like the base\n * {@link BroadcastReceiver#onReceive(Context, Intent) BroadcastReceiver.onReceive()}\n * method, happen on the main thread of the process.  Thus long running\n * operations must be done on another thread.  Note that because a receiver\n * is done once returning from its receive function, such long-running operations\n * should probably be done in a {@link Service}.\n *\n * <p>When publishing your DeviceAdmin subclass as a receiver, it must\n * handle {@link #ACTION_DEVICE_ADMIN_ENABLED} and require the\n * {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN} permission.  A typical\n * manifest entry would look like:</p>\n *\n * {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/AndroidManifest.xml device_admin_declaration}\n *\n * <p>The meta-data referenced here provides addition information specific\n * to the device administrator, as parsed by the {@link DeviceAdminInfo} class.\n * A typical file would be:</p>\n *\n * {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/xml/device_admin_sample.xml meta_data}\n *\n * <div class=\"special reference\">\n * <h3>Developer Guides</h3>\n * <p>For more information about device administration, read the\n * <a href=\"{@docRoot}guide/topics/admin/device-admin.html\">Device Administration</a>\n * developer guide.</p>\n * </div>\n ",
