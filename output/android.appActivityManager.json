However, a few methods are more broadly applicable.\n * For instance, {@link android.app.ActivityManager#isLowRamDevice() isLowRamDevice()}\n * enables your app to detect whether it is running on a low-memory device,\n * and behave accordingly.\n * {@link android.app.ActivityManager#clearApplicationUserData() clearApplicationUserData()}\n * is for apps with reset-data functionality.\n * </p>\n *\n * <p>\n * In some special use cases, where an app interacts with\n * its Task stack, the app may use the\n * {@link android.app.ActivityManager.AppTask} and\n * {@link android.app.ActivityManager.RecentTaskInfo} inner\n * classes. However, in general, the methods in this class should\n * be used for testing and debugging purposes only.\n * </p>\n ",
