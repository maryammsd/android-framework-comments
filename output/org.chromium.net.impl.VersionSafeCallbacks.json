  "comment" : "\n * This class contains wrapper classes for all Cronet API callback/listener classes. These classes\n * only permit callbacks that the version of the client API is known to support.  For example, if\n * version 2 of the API adds a callback onFoo() but the client API this class is implementing is\n * version 1, these wrapper classes should not call {@code mWrappedCallback.onFoo()} and should\n * instead silently drop the callback.\n *\n * When adding any callback wrapping here, be sure you add the proper version check.  Only callbacks\n * supported in all versions of the API should forgo a version check.\n ",
