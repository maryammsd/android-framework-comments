  "comment" : "\n * Common and useful TemporalAdjusters.\n * <p>\n * Adjusters are a key tool for modifying temporal objects.\n * They exist to externalize the process of adjustment, permitting different\n * approaches, as per the strategy design pattern.\n * Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, or one that\n * sets the date to the last day of the month.\n * <p>\n * There are two equivalent ways of using a {@code TemporalAdjuster}.\n * The first is to invoke the method on the interface directly.\n * The second is to use {@link Temporal#with(TemporalAdjuster)}:\n * <pre>\n *   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended\n *   temporal = thisAdjuster.adjustInto(temporal);\n *   temporal = temporal.with(thisAdjuster);\n * </pre>\n * It is recommended to use the second approach, {@code with(TemporalAdjuster)},\n * as it is a lot clearer to read in code.\n * <p>\n * This class contains a standard set of adjusters, available as static methods.\n * These include:\n * <ul>\n * <li>finding the first or last day of the month\n * <li>finding the first day of next month\n * <li>finding the first or last day of the year\n * <li>finding the first day of next year\n * <li>finding the first or last day-of-week within a month, such as \"first Wednesday in June\"\n * <li>finding the next or previous day-of-week, such as \"next Thursday\"\n * </ul>\n *\n * @implSpec\n * All the implementations supplied by the static methods are immutable.\n *\n * @see TemporalAdjuster\n * @since 1.8\n ",
