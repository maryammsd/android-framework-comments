  "comment" : "\n * This class creates sockets.  It may be subclassed by other factories,\n * which create particular subclasses of sockets and thus provide a general\n * framework for the addition of public socket-level functionality.\n *\n * <P> Socket factories are a simple way to capture a variety of policies\n * related to the sockets being constructed, producing such sockets in\n * a way which does not require special configuration of the code which\n * asks for the sockets:  <UL>\n *\n *      <LI> Due to polymorphism of both factories and sockets, different\n *      kinds of sockets can be used by the same application code just\n *      by passing it different kinds of factories.\n *\n *      <LI> Factories can themselves be customized with parameters used\n *      in socket construction.  So for example, factories could be\n *      customized to return sockets with different networking timeouts\n *      or security parameters already configured.\n *\n *      <LI> The sockets returned to the application can be subclasses\n *      of java.net.Socket, so that they can directly expose new APIs\n *      for features such as compression, security, record marking,\n *      statistics collection, or firewall tunneling.\n *\n *      </UL>\n *\n * <P> Factory classes are specified by environment-specific configuration\n * mechanisms.  For example, the <em>getDefault</em> method could return\n * a factory that was appropriate for a particular user or applet, and a\n * framework could use a factory customized to its own purposes.\n *\n * @since 1.4\n * @see ServerSocketFactory\n *\n * @author David Brownell\n ",
