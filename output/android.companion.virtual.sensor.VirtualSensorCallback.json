Similarly, the rate and delay of the injected\n * events that the registered listeners expect are specified here.\n *\n * <p>The callback is tied to the VirtualDevice's lifetime as the virtual sensors are created when\n * the device is created and destroyed when the device is destroyed.\n *\n * @hide\n ",
