  "comment" : "\n * Delegate implementing the native methods of android.graphics.PathDashPathEffect\n *\n * Through the layoutlib_create tool, the original native methods of PathDashPathEffect have been\n * replaced by calls to methods of the same name in this delegate class.\n *\n * This class behaves like the original native implementation, but in Java, keeping previously\n * native data into its own objects and mapping them to int that are sent back and forth between\n * it and the original PathDashPathEffect class.\n *\n * Because this extends {@link PathEffect_Delegate}, there's no need to use a {@link DelegateManager},\n * as all the Shader classes will be added to the manager owned by {@link PathEffect_Delegate}.\n *\n * @see PathEffect_Delegate\n *\n ",
