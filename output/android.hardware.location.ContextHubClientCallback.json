Callbacks are invoked in\n * the following ways:\n * 1) Messages from nanoapps delivered through onMessageFromNanoApp may either be broadcasted\n *    or targeted to a specific client.\n * 2) Nanoapp or Context Hub events (the remaining callbacks) are broadcasted to all clients, and\n *    the client can choose to ignore the event by filtering through the parameters.\n *\n * @hide\n ",
