Contains\n * definitions for the supported URIs and columns.\n *\n * <P>The content providers exposes two tables through this interface:\n * <ul>\n *   <li> Voicemails table: This stores the actual voicemail records. The\n *   columns and URIs for accessing this table are defined by the\n *   {@link Voicemails} class.\n *   </li>\n *   <li> Status table: This provides a way for the voicemail source application\n *   to convey its current state to the system. The columns and URIS for\n *   accessing this table are defined by the {@link Status} class.\n *   </li>\n * </ul>\n *\n * <P> The minimum permission needed to access this content provider is\n * {@link android.Manifest.permission#ADD_VOICEMAIL} or carrier privileges (see\n * {@link android.telephony.TelephonyManager#hasCarrierPrivileges}).\n *\n * <P>Voicemails are inserted by what is called as a \"voicemail source\"\n * application, which is responsible for syncing voicemail data between a remote\n * server and the local voicemail content provider. \"voicemail source\"\n * application should always set the {@link #PARAM_KEY_SOURCE_PACKAGE} in the\n * URI to identify its package.\n *\n * <P>In addition to the {@link ContentObserver} notifications the voicemail\n * provider also generates broadcast intents to notify change for applications\n * that are not active and therefore cannot listen to ContentObserver\n * notifications. Broadcast intents with following actions are generated:\n * <ul>\n *   <li> {@link #ACTION_NEW_VOICEMAIL} is generated for each new voicemail\n *   inserted.\n *   </li>\n *   <li> {@link Intent#ACTION_PROVIDER_CHANGED} is generated for any change\n *    made into the database, including new voicemail.\n *   </li>\n * </ul>\n ",
