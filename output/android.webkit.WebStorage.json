Use of the Application\n * Cache API can be attributed to an origin {@link WebStorage.Origin}, however\n * it is not possible to set per-origin quotas. Note that there can be only\n * one application cache per application.\n *\n * The Web SQL Database API provides storage which is private to a given origin.\n * Similar to the Application Cache, use of the Web SQL Database can be attributed\n * to an origin. It is also possible to set per-origin quotas.\n ",
