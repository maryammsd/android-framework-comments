For example:</p>\n * <pre>\n *     &lt;service android:name=\".MyResolverRankerService\"\n *             android:exported=\"true\"\n *             android:priority=\"100\"\n *             android:permission=\"android.permission.BIND_RESOLVER_RANKER_SERVICE\"&gt;\n *         &lt;intent-filter&gt;\n *             &lt;action android:name=\"android.service.resolver.ResolverRankerService\" /&gt;\n *         &lt;/intent-filter&gt;\n *     &lt;/service&gt;\n * </pre>\n * @hide\n ",
