  "comment" : "\n * Contains the list of carrier restrictions.\n * Allowed list: it indicates the list of carriers that are allowed.\n * Excluded list: it indicates the list of carriers that are excluded.\n * Default carrier restriction: it indicates the default behavior and the priority between the two\n * lists:\n *  - not allowed: the device only allows usage of carriers that are present in the allowed list\n *    and not present in the excluded list. This implies that if a carrier is not present in either\n *    list, it is not allowed.\n *  - allowed: the device allows all carriers, except those present in the excluded list and not\n *    present in the allowed list. This implies that if a carrier is not present in either list,\n *    it is allowed.\n * MultiSim policy: it indicates the behavior in case of devices with two or more SIM cards.\n *  - MULTISIM_POLICY_NONE: the same configuration is applied to all SIM slots independently. This\n *    is the default value if none is set.\n *  - MULTISIM_POLICY_ONE_VALID_SIM_MUST_BE_PRESENT: it indicates that any SIM card can be used\n *    as far as one SIM card matching the configuration is present in the device.\n *\n * Both lists support the character '?' as wild character. For example, an entry indicating\n * MCC=310 and MNC=??? will match all networks with MCC=310.\n *\n * Example 1: Allowed list contains MCC and MNC of operator A. Excluded list contains operator B,\n *            which has same MCC and MNC, but also GID1 value. The priority allowed list is set\n *            to true. Only SIM cards of operator A are allowed, but not those of B or any other\n *            operator.\n * Example 2: Allowed list contains MCC and MNC of operator A. Excluded list contains an entry\n *            with same MCC, and '???' as MNC. The priority allowed list is set to false.\n *            SIM cards of operator A and all SIM cards with a different MCC value are allowed.\n *            SIM cards of operators with same MCC value and different MNC are not allowed.\n * @hide\n ",
