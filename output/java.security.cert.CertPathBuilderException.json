The {@link #getCause getCause} method returns the throwable,\n * if any, that caused this exception to be thrown.\n * <p>\n * <b>Concurrent Access</b>\n * <p>\n * Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not\n * thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single\n * object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and\n * provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating\n * separate objects need not synchronize.\n *\n * @see CertPathBuilder\n *\n * @since       1.4\n * @author      Sean Mullan\n ",
