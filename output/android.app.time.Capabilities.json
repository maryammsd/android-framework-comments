This\n * information is exposed so that system apps like SettingsUI can be dynamic, rather than\n * hard-coding knowledge of when configuration or actions are applicable / available to the user.\n *\n * <p>Capabilities have states that users cannot change directly. They may influence some\n * capabilities indirectly by agreeing to certain device-wide behaviors such as location sharing, or\n * by changing the configuration. See the {@code CAPABILITY_} constants for details.\n *\n * <p>Actions have associated methods, see the documentation for each action for details.\n *\n * <p>Note: Capabilities are independent of app permissions required to call the associated APIs.\n *\n * @hide\n ",
