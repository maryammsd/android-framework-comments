It can be substantial.\n * <p>\n * <b>Battery Usage</b><br>\n * Since Android version {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q}, the statistics related to power\n * (battery) usage are recorded since the device was last considered fully charged (for previous\n * versions, it is instead since the device was last unplugged).\n * It is expected that applications schedule more work to do while the device is\n * plugged in (e.g. using {@link android.app.job.JobScheduler JobScheduler}), and\n * while that can affect charging rates, it is still preferable to actually draining\n * the battery.\n ",
