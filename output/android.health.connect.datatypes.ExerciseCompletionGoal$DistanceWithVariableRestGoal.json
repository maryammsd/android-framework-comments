Time remaining after the\n     * specified distance has been completed should be spent resting. In the context of swimming,\n     * this is sometimes referred to as 'interval training'.\n     *\n     * <p>For example, a swimming coach may specify '100m @ 1min40s'. This implies: complete 100m\n     * and if you manage it in 1min30s, you will have 10s of rest prior to the next set.\n     ",
