  "comment" : "\n * This error can occur if the application creates a SQLiteStatement object and allows multiple\n * threads in the application use it at the same time.\n * Sqlite returns this error if bind and execute methods on this object occur at the same time\n * from multiple threads, like so:\n *     thread # 1: in execute() method of the SQLiteStatement object\n *     while thread # 2: is in bind..() on the same object.\n *</p>\n * FIX this by NEVER sharing the same SQLiteStatement object between threads.\n * Create a local instance of the SQLiteStatement whenever it is needed, use it and close it ASAP.\n * NEVER make it globally available.\n ",
