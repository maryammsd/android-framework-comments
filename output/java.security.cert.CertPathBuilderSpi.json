  "comment" : "\n * The <i>Service Provider Interface</i> (<b>SPI</b>)\n * for the {@link CertPathBuilder CertPathBuilder} class. All\n * {@code CertPathBuilder} implementations must include a class (the\n * SPI class) that extends this class ({@code CertPathBuilderSpi}) and\n * implements all of its methods. In general, instances of this class should\n * only be accessed through the {@code CertPathBuilder} class. For\n * details, see the Java Cryptography Architecture.\n * <p>\n * <b>Concurrent Access</b>\n * <p>\n * Instances of this class need not be protected against concurrent\n * access from multiple threads. Threads that need to access a single\n * {@code CertPathBuilderSpi} instance concurrently should synchronize\n * amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking before calling the\n * wrapping {@code CertPathBuilder} object.\n * <p>\n * However, implementations of {@code CertPathBuilderSpi} may still\n * encounter concurrency issues, since multiple threads each\n * manipulating a different {@code CertPathBuilderSpi} instance need not\n * synchronize.\n *\n * @since       1.4\n * @author      Sean Mullan\n ",
