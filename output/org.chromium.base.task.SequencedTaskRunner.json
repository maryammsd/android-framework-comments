Unless specified otherwise by the provider of a given\n * SequencedTaskRunner, tasks posted to it have no ordering, nor mutual exclusion, execution\n * guarantees w.r.t. other SequencedTaskRunners. They have destroy() automatically called whenever\n * they go empty, so calling destroy() on them is not needed.\n ",
