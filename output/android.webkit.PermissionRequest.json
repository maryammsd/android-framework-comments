To\n * avoid unintentionally granting requests for new permissions, you should pass the\n * specific permissions you intend to grant to {@link #grant(String[]) grant()},\n * and avoid writing code like this example:\n * <pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n * permissionRequest.grant(permissionRequest.getResources())  // This is wrong!!!\n * </pre>\n * See the WebView's release notes for information about new protected resources.\n ",
