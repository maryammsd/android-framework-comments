  "comment" : "\n * CDATA sections are used to escape blocks of text containing characters that\n * would otherwise be regarded as markup. The only delimiter that is\n * recognized in a CDATA section is the \"]]&gt;\" string that ends the CDATA\n * section. CDATA sections cannot be nested. Their primary purpose is for\n * including material such as XML fragments, without needing to escape all\n * the delimiters.\n * <p>The <code>CharacterData.data</code> attribute holds the text that is\n * contained by the CDATA section. Note that this <em>may</em> contain characters that need to be escaped outside of CDATA sections and\n * that, depending on the character encoding (\"charset\") chosen for\n * serialization, it may be impossible to write out some characters as part\n * of a CDATA section.\n * <p>The <code>CDATASection</code> interface inherits from the\n * <code>CharacterData</code> interface through the <code>Text</code>\n * interface. Adjacent <code>CDATASection</code> nodes are not merged by use\n * of the <code>normalize</code> method of the <code>Node</code> interface.\n * <p> No lexical check is done on the content of a CDATA section and it is\n * therefore possible to have the character sequence <code>\"]]&gt;\"</code>\n * in the content, which is illegal in a CDATA section per section 2.7 of [<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204'>XML 1.0</a>]. The\n * presence of this character sequence must generate a fatal error during\n * serialization or the cdata section must be splitted before the\n * serialization (see also the parameter <code>\"split-cdata-sections\"</code>\n * in the <code>DOMConfiguration</code> interface).\n * <p ><b>Note:</b> Because no markup is recognized within a\n * <code>CDATASection</code>, character numeric references cannot be used as\n * an escape mechanism when serializing. Therefore, action needs to be taken\n * when serializing a <code>CDATASection</code> with a character encoding\n * where some of the contained characters cannot be represented. Failure to\n * do so would not produce well-formed XML.\n * <p ><b>Note:</b> One potential solution in the serialization process is to\n * end the CDATA section before the character, output the character using a\n * character reference or entity reference, and open a new CDATA section for\n * any further characters in the text node. Note, however, that some code\n * conversion libraries at the time of writing do not return an error or\n * exception when a character is missing from the encoding, making the task\n * of ensuring that data is not corrupted on serialization more difficult.\n * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification</a>.\n ",
