Calling the method <code>execute</code> will\n   * cause an <code>SQLException</code> to be thrown\n   * because <code>execute</code> may not be called recursively.  Also,\n   * when a reader invokes <code>RowSet</code> methods, no listeners\n   * are notified; that is, no <code>RowSetEvent</code> objects are\n   * generated and no <code>RowSetListener</code> methods are invoked.\n   * This is true because listeners are already being notified by the method\n   * <code>execute</code>.\n   *\n   * @param caller the <code>RowSet</code> object (1) that has implemented the\n   *         <code>RowSetInternal</code> interface, (2) with which this reader is\n   *        registered, and (3) whose <code>execute</code> method called this reader\n   * @exception SQLException if a database access error occurs or this method\n   *            invokes the <code>RowSet.execute</code> method\n   ",
