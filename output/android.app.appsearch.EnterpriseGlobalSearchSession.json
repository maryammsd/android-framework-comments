Databases may have additional required permissions and restricted fields\n * when accessed through an enterprise session that they normally would not have.\n *\n * <p>EnterpriseGlobalSearchSession will only return results when created from the main user context\n * and when there is an associated work profile. If the given context is either not the main user or\n * does not have a work profile, queries will successfully complete with empty results, allowing\n * clients to query the work profile without having to account for whether it exists or not.\n ",
