They\n * would only be called if you wanted to trigger a view of voice search results in your\n * application, or implemented if you wanted to offer a different view for voice search results\n * with your application.\n * \n * The standard behavior here for someone receiving an {@link #ACTION_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULTS} is to\n * first retrieve the list of {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_STRINGS}, and use any provided\n * HTML for that result in {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_HTML}, if available, to display\n * the search results. If that is not available, then the corresponding url for that result in\n * {@link #EXTRA_VOICE_SEARCH_RESULT_URLS} should be used. And if even that is not available,\n * then a search url should be constructed from the actual recognition result string.\n ",
