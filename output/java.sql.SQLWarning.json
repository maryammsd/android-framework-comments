Trying to retrieve a warning on a\n * connection after it has been closed will cause an exception to be thrown.\n * Similarly, trying to retrieve a warning on a statement after it has been\n * closed or on a result set after it has been closed will cause\n * an exception to be thrown. Note that closing a statement also\n * closes a result set that it might have produced.\n *\n * @see Connection#getWarnings\n * @see Statement#getWarnings\n * @see ResultSet#getWarnings\n ",
