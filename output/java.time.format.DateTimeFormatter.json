  "comment" : "\n * Formatter for printing and parsing date-time objects.\n * <p>\n * This class provides the main application entry point for printing and parsing\n * and provides common implementations of {@code DateTimeFormatter}:\n * <ul>\n * <li>Using predefined constants, such as {@link #ISO_LOCAL_DATE}</li>\n * <li>Using pattern letters, such as {@code uuuu-MMM-dd}</li>\n * <li>Using localized styles, such as {@code long} or {@code medium}</li>\n * </ul>\n * <p>\n * More complex formatters are provided by\n * {@link DateTimeFormatterBuilder DateTimeFormatterBuilder}.\n *\n * <p>\n * The main date-time classes provide two methods - one for formatting,\n * {@code format(DateTimeFormatter formatter)}, and one for parsing,\n * {@code parse(CharSequence text, DateTimeFormatter formatter)}.\n * <p>For example:\n * <blockquote><pre>\n *  LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();\n *  String text = date.format(formatter);\n *  LocalDate parsedDate = LocalDate.parse(text, formatter);\n * </pre></blockquote>\n * <p>\n * In addition to the format, formatters can be created with desired Locale,\n * Chronology, ZoneId, and DecimalStyle.\n * <p>\n * The {@link #withLocale withLocale} method returns a new formatter that\n * overrides the locale. The locale affects some aspects of formatting and\n * parsing. For example, the {@link #ofLocalizedDate ofLocalizedDate} provides a\n * formatter that uses the locale specific date format.\n * <p>\n * The {@link #withChronology withChronology} method returns a new formatter\n * that overrides the chronology. If overridden, the date-time value is\n * converted to the chronology before formatting. During parsing the date-time\n * value is converted to the chronology before it is returned.\n * <p>\n * The {@link #withZone withZone} method returns a new formatter that overrides\n * the zone. If overridden, the date-time value is converted to a ZonedDateTime\n * with the requested ZoneId before formatting. During parsing the ZoneId is\n * applied before the value is returned.\n * <p>\n * The {@link #withDecimalStyle withDecimalStyle} method returns a new formatter that\n * overrides the {@link DecimalStyle}. The DecimalStyle symbols are used for\n * formatting and parsing.\n * <p>\n * Some applications may need to use the older {@link Format java.text.Format}\n * class for formatting. The {@link #toFormat()} method returns an\n * implementation of {@code java.text.Format}.\n *\n * <h2 id=\"predefined\">Predefined Formatters</h2>\n * <table class=\"striped\" style=\"text-align:left\">\n * <caption>Predefined Formatters</caption>\n * <thead>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"col\">Formatter</th>\n * <th scope=\"col\">Description</th>\n * <th scope=\"col\">Example</th>\n * </tr>\n * </thead>\n * <tbody>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\">{@link #ofLocalizedDate ofLocalizedDate(dateStyle)} </th>\n * <td> Formatter with date style from the locale </td>\n * <td> '2011-12-03'</td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #ofLocalizedTime ofLocalizedTime(timeStyle)} </th>\n * <td> Formatter with time style from the locale </td>\n * <td> '10:15:30'</td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #ofLocalizedDateTime ofLocalizedDateTime(dateTimeStyle)} </th>\n * <td> Formatter with a style for date and time from the locale</td>\n * <td> '3 Jun 2008 11:05:30'</td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #ofLocalizedDateTime ofLocalizedDateTime(dateStyle,timeStyle)}\n * </th>\n * <td> Formatter with date and time styles from the locale </td>\n * <td> '3 Jun 2008 11:05'</td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #BASIC_ISO_DATE}</th>\n * <td>Basic ISO date </td> <td>'20111203'</td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #ISO_LOCAL_DATE}</th>\n * <td> ISO Local Date </td>\n * <td>'2011-12-03'</td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #ISO_OFFSET_DATE}</th>\n * <td> ISO Date with offset </td>\n * <td>'2011-12-03+01:00'</td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #ISO_DATE}</th>\n * <td> ISO Date with or without offset </td>\n * <td> '2011-12-03+01:00'; '2011-12-03'</td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #ISO_LOCAL_TIME}</th>\n * <td> Time without offset </td>\n * <td>'10:15:30'</td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #ISO_OFFSET_TIME}</th>\n * <td> Time with offset </td>\n * <td>'10:15:30+01:00'</td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #ISO_TIME}</th>\n * <td> Time with or without offset </td>\n * <td>'10:15:30+01:00'; '10:15:30'</td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #ISO_LOCAL_DATE_TIME}</th>\n * <td> ISO Local Date and Time </td>\n * <td>'2011-12-03T10:15:30'</td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #ISO_OFFSET_DATE_TIME}</th>\n * <td> Date Time with Offset\n * </td><td>'2011-12-03T10:15:30+01:00'</td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #ISO_ZONED_DATE_TIME}</th>\n * <td> Zoned Date Time </td>\n * <td>'2011-12-03T10:15:30+01:00[Europe/Paris]'</td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #ISO_DATE_TIME}</th>\n * <td> Date and time with ZoneId </td>\n * <td>'2011-12-03T10:15:30+01:00[Europe/Paris]'</td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #ISO_ORDINAL_DATE}</th>\n * <td> Year and day of year </td>\n * <td>'2012-337'</td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #ISO_WEEK_DATE}</th>\n * <td> Year and Week </td>\n * <td>'2012-W48-6'</td></tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #ISO_INSTANT}</th>\n * <td> Date and Time of an Instant </td>\n * <td>'2011-12-03T10:15:30Z' </td>\n * </tr>\n * <tr>\n * <th scope=\"row\"> {@link #RFC_1123_DATE_TIME}</th>\n * <td> RFC 1123 / RFC 822 </td>\n * <td>'Tue, 3 Jun 2008 11:05:30 GMT'</td>\n * </tr>\n * </tbody>\n * </table>\n *\n * <h2 id=\"patterns\">Patterns for Formatting and Parsing</h2>\n * Patterns are based on a simple sequence of letters and symbols.\n * A pattern is used to create a Formatter using the\n * {@link #ofPattern(String)} and {@link #ofPattern(String, Locale)} methods.\n * For example,\n * {@code \"d MMM uuuu\"} will format 2011-12-03 as '3&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;2011'.\n * A formatter created from a pattern can be used as many times as necessary,\n * it is immutable and is thread-safe.\n * <p>\n * For example:\n * <blockquote><pre>\n *  LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();\n *  DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(\"yyyy MM dd\");\n *  String text = date.format(formatter);\n *  LocalDate parsedDate = LocalDate.parse(text, formatter);\n * </pre></blockquote>\n * <p>\n * All letters 'A' to 'Z' and 'a' to 'z' are reserved as pattern letters.

Less than 4 pattern letters will use the\n * {@link TextStyle#SHORT short form}. Exactly 4 pattern letters will use the\n * {@link TextStyle#FULL full form}. Exactly 5 pattern letters will use the\n * {@link TextStyle#NARROW narrow form}.\n * Pattern letters 'L', 'c', and 'q' specify the stand-alone form of the text styles.\n * <p>\n * <b>Number</b>: If the count of letters is one, then the value is output using\n * the minimum number of digits and without padding. Otherwise, the count of digits\n * is used as the width of the output field, with the value zero-padded as necessary.\n * The following pattern letters have constraints on the count of letters.\n * Only one letter of 'c' and 'F' can be specified.\n * Up to two letters of 'd', 'H', 'h', 'K', 'k', 'm', and 's' can be specified.\n * Up to three letters of 'D' can be specified.\n * <p>\n * <b>Number/Text</b>: If the count of pattern letters is 3 or greater, use the\n * Text rules above. Otherwise use the Number rules above.\n * <p>\n * <b>Fraction</b>: Outputs the nano-of-second field as a fraction-of-second.\n * The nano-of-second value has nine digits, thus the count of pattern letters\n * is from 1 to 9. If it is less than 9, then the nano-of-second value is\n * truncated, with only the most significant digits being output.\n * <p>\n * <b>Year</b>: The count of letters determines the minimum field width below\n * which padding is used. If the count of letters is two, then a\n * {@link DateTimeFormatterBuilder#appendValueReduced reduced} two digit form is\n * used. For printing, this outputs the rightmost two digits. For parsing, this\n * will parse using the base value of 2000, resulting in a year within the range\n * 2000 to 2099 inclusive. If the count of letters is less than four (but not\n * two), then the sign is only output for negative years as per\n * {@link SignStyle#NORMAL}. Otherwise, the sign is output if the pad width is\n * exceeded, as per {@link SignStyle#EXCEEDS_PAD}.\n * <p>\n * <b>ZoneId</b>: This outputs the time-zone ID, such as 'Europe/Paris'. If the\n * count of letters is two, then the time-zone ID is output. Any other count of\n * letters throws {@code IllegalArgumentException}.\n * <p>\n * <b>Zone names</b>: This outputs the display name of the time-zone ID. If the\n * pattern letter is 'z' the output is the daylight savings aware zone name.\n * If there is insufficient information to determine whether DST applies,\n * the name ignoring daylight savings time will be used.\n * If the count of letters is one, two or three, then the short name is output.\n * If the count of letters is four, then the full name is output.\n * Five or more letters throws {@code IllegalArgumentException}.\n * <p>\n * If the pattern letter is 'v' the output provides the zone name ignoring\n * daylight savings time. If the count of letters is one, then the short name is output.\n * If the count of letters is four, then the full name is output.\n * Two, three and five or more letters throw {@code IllegalArgumentException}.\n * <p>\n * <b>Offset X and x</b>: This formats the offset based on the number of pattern\n * letters. One letter outputs just the hour, such as '+01', unless the minute\n * is non-zero in which case the minute is also output, such as '+0130'. Two\n * letters outputs the hour and minute, without a colon, such as '+0130'. Three\n * letters outputs the hour and minute, with a colon, such as '+01:30'. Four\n * letters outputs the hour and minute and optional second, without a colon,\n * such as '+013015'. Five letters outputs the hour and minute and optional\n * second, with a colon, such as '+01:30:15'. Six or more letters throws\n * {@code IllegalArgumentException}. Pattern letter 'X' (upper case) will output\n * 'Z' when the offset to be output would be zero, whereas pattern letter 'x'\n * (lower case) will output '+00', '+0000', or '+00:00'.\n * <p>\n * <b>Offset O</b>: With a non-zero offset, this formats the localized offset\n * based on the number of pattern letters. One letter outputs the\n * {@linkplain TextStyle#SHORT short} form of the localized offset, which is\n * localized offset text, such as 'GMT', with hour without leading zero, optional\n * 2-digit minute and second if non-zero, and colon, for example 'GMT+8'. Four\n * letters outputs the {@linkplain TextStyle#FULL full} form, which is localized\n * offset text, such as 'GMT, with 2-digit hour and minute field, optional second\n * field if non-zero, and colon, for example 'GMT+08:00'. If the offset is zero,\n * only localized text is output. Any other count of letters throws\n * {@code IllegalArgumentException}.\n * <p>\n * <b>Offset Z</b>: This formats the offset based on the number of pattern\n * letters. One, two or three letters outputs the hour and minute, without a\n * colon, such as '+0130'. The output will be '+0000' when the offset is zero.\n * Four letters outputs the {@linkplain TextStyle#FULL full} form of localized\n * offset, equivalent to four letters of Offset-O. The output will be the\n * corresponding localized offset text if the offset is zero. Five\n * letters outputs the hour, minute, with optional second if non-zero, with\n * colon. It outputs 'Z' if the offset is zero.\n * Six or more letters throws {@code IllegalArgumentException}.\n * <p>\n * <b>Optional section</b>: The optional section markers work exactly like\n * calling {@link DateTimeFormatterBuilder#optionalStart()} and\n * {@link DateTimeFormatterBuilder#optionalEnd()}.\n * <p>\n * <b>Pad modifier</b>: Modifies the pattern that immediately follows to be\n * padded with spaces. The pad width is determined by the number of pattern\n * letters. This is the same as calling\n * {@link DateTimeFormatterBuilder#padNext(int)}.\n * <p>\n * For example, 'ppH' outputs the hour-of-day padded on the left with spaces to\n * a width of 2.\n * <p>\n * Any unrecognized letter is an error. Any non-letter character, other than\n * '[', ']', '{', '}', '#' and the single quote will be output directly.\n * Despite this, it is recommended to use single quotes around all characters\n * that you want to output directly to ensure that future changes do not break\n * your application.\n *\n * <h2 id=\"resolving\">Resolving</h2>\n * Parsing is implemented as a two-phase operation.\n * First, the text is parsed using the layout defined by the formatter, producing\n * a {@code Map} of field to value, a {@code ZoneId} and a {@code Chronology}.\n * Second, the parsed data is <em>resolved</em>, by validating, combining and\n * simplifying the various fields into more useful ones.\n * <p>\n * Five parsing methods are supplied by this class.\n * Four of these perform both the parse and resolve phases.\n * The fifth method, {@link #parseUnresolved(CharSequence, ParsePosition)},\n * only performs the first phase, leaving the result unresolved.\n * As such, it is essentially a low-level operation.\n * <p>\n * The resolve phase is controlled by two parameters, set on this class.\n * <p>\n * The {@link ResolverStyle} is an enum that offers three different approaches,\n * strict, smart and lenient. The smart option is the default.\n * It can be set using {@link #withResolverStyle(ResolverStyle)}.\n * <p>\n * The {@link #withResolverFields(TemporalField...)} parameter allows the\n * set of fields that will be resolved to be filtered before resolving starts.\n * For example, if the formatter has parsed a year, month, day-of-month\n * and day-of-year, then there are two approaches to resolve a date:\n * (year + month + day-of-month) and (year + day-of-year).\n * The resolver fields allows one of the two approaches to be selected.\n * If no resolver fields are set then both approaches must result in the same date.\n * <p>\n * Resolving separate fields to form a complete date and time is a complex\n * process with behaviour distributed across a number of classes.\n * It follows these steps:\n * <ol>\n * <li>The chronology is determined.\n * The chronology of the result is either the chronology that was parsed,\n * or if no chronology was parsed, it is the chronology set on this class,\n * or if that is null, it is {@code IsoChronology}.\n * <li>The {@code ChronoField} date fields are resolved.\n * This is achieved using {@link Chronology#resolveDate(Map, ResolverStyle)}.\n * Documentation about field resolution is located in the implementation\n * of {@code Chronology}.\n * <li>The {@code ChronoField} time fields are resolved.\n * This is documented on {@link ChronoField} and is the same for all chronologies.\n * <li>Any fields that are not {@code ChronoField} are processed.\n * This is achieved using {@link TemporalField#resolve(Map, TemporalAccessor, ResolverStyle)}.\n * Documentation about field resolution is located in the implementation\n * of {@code TemporalField}.\n * <li>The {@code ChronoField} date and time fields are re-resolved.\n * This allows fields in step four to produce {@code ChronoField} values\n * and have them be processed into dates and times.\n * <li>A {@code LocalTime} is formed if there is at least an hour-of-day available.\n * This involves providing default values for minute, second and fraction of second.\n * <li>Any remaining unresolved fields are cross-checked against any\n * date and/or time that was resolved. Thus, an earlier stage would resolve\n * (year + month + day-of-month) to a date, and this stage would check that\n * day-of-week was valid for the date.\n * <li>If an {@linkplain #parsedExcessDays() excess number of days}\n * was parsed then it is added to the date if a date is available.\n * <li> If a second-based field is present, but {@code LocalTime} was not parsed,\n * then the resolver ensures that milli, micro and nano second values are\n * available to meet the contract of {@link ChronoField}.\n * These will be set to zero if missing.\n * <li>If both date and time were parsed and either an offset or zone is present,\n * the field {@link ChronoField#INSTANT_SECONDS} is created.\n * If an offset was parsed then the offset will be combined with the\n * {@code LocalDateTime} to form the instant, with any zone ignored.\n * If a {@code ZoneId} was parsed without an offset then the zone will be\n * combined with the {@code LocalDateTime} to form the instant using the rules\n * of {@link ChronoLocalDateTime#atZone(ZoneId)}.\n * </ol>\n *\n * @implSpec\n * This class is immutable and thread-safe.\n *\n * @since 1.8\n ",
