  "comment" : "\n * Basic thread blocking primitives for creating locks and other\n * synchronization classes.\n *\n * <p>This class associates, with each thread that uses it, a permit\n * (in the sense of the {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore\n * Semaphore} class). A call to {@code park} will return immediately\n * if the permit is available, consuming it in the process; otherwise\n * it <em>may</em> block.  A call to {@code unpark} makes the permit\n * available, if it was not already available. (Unlike with Semaphores\n * though, permits do not accumulate. There is at most one.)\n * Reliable usage requires the use of volatile (or atomic) variables\n * to control when to park or unpark.  Orderings of calls to these\n * methods are maintained with respect to volatile variable accesses,\n * but not necessarily non-volatile variable accesses.\n *\n * <p>Methods {@code park} and {@code unpark} provide efficient\n * means of blocking and unblocking threads that do not encounter the\n * problems that cause the deprecated methods {@code Thread.suspend}\n * and {@code Thread.resume} to be unusable for such purposes: Races\n * between one thread invoking {@code park} and another thread trying\n * to {@code unpark} it will preserve liveness, due to the\n * permit. Additionally, {@code park} will return if the caller's\n * thread was interrupted, and timeout versions are supported. The\n * {@code park} method may also return at any other time, for \"no\n * reason\", so in general must be invoked within a loop that rechecks\n * conditions upon return. In this sense {@code park} serves as an\n * optimization of a \"busy wait\" that does not waste as much time\n * spinning, but must be paired with an {@code unpark} to be\n * effective.\n *\n * <p>The three forms of {@code park} each also support a\n * {@code blocker} object parameter. This object is recorded while\n * the thread is blocked to permit monitoring and diagnostic tools to\n * identify the reasons that threads are blocked. (Such tools may\n * access blockers using method {@link #getBlocker(Thread)}.)\n * The use of these forms rather than the original forms without this\n * parameter is strongly encouraged. The normal argument to supply as\n * a {@code blocker} within a lock implementation is {@code this}.\n *\n * <p>These methods are designed to be used as tools for creating\n * higher-level synchronization utilities, and are not in themselves\n * useful for most concurrency control applications.  The {@code park}\n * method is designed for use only in constructions of the form:\n *\n * <pre> {@code\n * while (!canProceed()) {\n *   // ensure request to unpark is visible to other threads\n *   ...\n *   LockSupport.park(this);\n * }}</pre>\n *\n * where no actions by the thread publishing a request to unpark,\n * prior to the call to {@code park}, entail locking or blocking.\n * Because only one permit is associated with each thread, any\n * intermediary uses of {@code park}, including implicitly via class\n * loading, could lead to an unresponsive thread (a \"lost unpark\").\n *\n * <p><b>Sample Usage.</b> Here is a sketch of a first-in-first-out\n * non-reentrant lock class:\n * <pre> {@code\n * class FIFOMutex {\n *   private final AtomicBoolean locked = new AtomicBoolean(false);\n *   private final Queue<Thread> waiters\n *     = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();\n *\n *   public void lock() {\n *     boolean wasInterrupted = false;\n *     // publish current thread for unparkers\n *     waiters.add(Thread.currentThread());\n *\n *     // Block while not first in queue or cannot acquire lock\n *     while (waiters.peek() != Thread.currentThread() ||\n *            !locked.compareAndSet(false, true)) {\n *       LockSupport.park(this);\n *       // ignore interrupts while waiting\n *       if (Thread.interrupted())\n *         wasInterrupted = true;\n *     }\n *\n *     waiters.remove();\n *     // ensure correct interrupt status on return\n *     if (wasInterrupted)\n *       Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\n *   }\n *\n *   public void unlock() {\n *     locked.set(false);\n *     LockSupport.unpark(waiters.peek());\n *   }\n *\n *   static {\n *     // Reduce the risk of \"lost unpark\" due to classloading\n *     Class<?> ensureLoaded = LockSupport.class;\n *   }\n * }}</pre>\n *\n * @since 1.5\n ",
