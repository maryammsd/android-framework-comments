Given the lack of devices supporting the feature,\n   *             it is deprecated. Developers can use auth-bound Keystore keys as a partial\n   *             replacement.\n   * \n   * @param result\n   *  - ResponseCode.OK On success. In this case dataConfirmed must be non null.\n   *  - ResponseCode.CANCELLED If the user cancelled the prompt. In this case dataConfirmed must\n   *           be null.\n   *  - ResponseCode.ABORTED If the client called IProtectedConfirmation.cancelPrompt() or if the\n   *           prompt was cancelled by the system due to an asynchronous event. In this case\n   *           dataConfirmed must be null.\n   * \n   * @param dataConfirmed This is the message that was confirmed and for which a confirmation\n   *           token is now available in implementing service. A subsequent attempt to sign this\n   *           message with a confirmation bound key will succeed. The message is a CBOR map\n   *           including the prompt text and the extra data.\n   ",
