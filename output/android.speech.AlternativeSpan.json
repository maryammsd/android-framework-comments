For a specific\n * span of the originally recognized result string, the recognizer may provide alternative\n * hypotheses of what it may have recognized. A span is specifically a substring and is thereby\n * defined by its start and end positions in the originally recognized string. Alternative\n * hypotheses are represented as strings which may replace that substring.\n *\n * <p> These alternatives can be used to enhance recognition by adding/re-ranking/applying or in\n * other ways manipulating the SpeechRecognizer results before powering dictation features.\n ",
