  "comment" : "\n * An abstract implementation of a SyncAdapter that spawns a thread to invoke a sync operation.\n * If a sync operation is already in progress when a sync request is received, an error will be\n * returned to the new request and the existing request will be allowed to continue.\n * However if there is no sync in progress then a thread will be spawned and {@link #onPerformSync}\n * will be invoked on that thread.\n * <p>\n * Syncs can be cancelled at any time by the framework. For example a sync that was not\n * user-initiated and lasts longer than 30 minutes will be considered timed-out and cancelled.\n * Similarly the framework will attempt to determine whether or not an adapter is making progress\n * by monitoring its network activity over the course of a minute. If the network traffic over this\n * window is close enough to zero the sync will be cancelled. You can also request the sync be\n * cancelled via {@link ContentResolver#cancelSync(Account, String)} or\n * {@link ContentResolver#cancelSync(SyncRequest)}.\n * <p>\n * A sync is cancelled by issuing a {@link Thread#interrupt()} on the syncing thread. <strong>Either\n * your code in {@link #onPerformSync(Account, Bundle, String, ContentProviderClient, SyncResult)}\n * must check {@link Thread#interrupted()}, or you you must override one of\n * {@link #onSyncCanceled(Thread)}/{@link #onSyncCanceled()}</strong> (depending on whether or not\n * your adapter supports syncing of multiple accounts in parallel). If your adapter does not\n * respect the cancel issued by the framework you run the risk of your app's entire process being\n * killed.\n * <p>\n * In order to be a sync adapter one must extend this class, provide implementations for the\n * abstract methods and write a service that returns the result of {@link #getSyncAdapterBinder()}\n * in the service's {@link android.app.Service#onBind(android.content.Intent)} when invoked\n * with an intent with action <code>android.content.SyncAdapter</code>. This service\n * must specify the following intent filter and metadata tags in its AndroidManifest.xml file\n * <pre>\n *   &lt;intent-filter&gt;\n *     &lt;action android:name=\"android.content.SyncAdapter\" /&gt;\n *   &lt;/intent-filter&gt;\n *   &lt;meta-data android:name=\"android.content.SyncAdapter\"\n *             android:resource=\"@xml/syncadapter\" /&gt;\n * </pre>\n * The <code>android:resource</code> attribute must point to a resource that looks like:\n * <pre>\n * &lt;sync-adapter xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n *    android:contentAuthority=\"authority\"\n *    android:accountType=\"accountType\"\n *    android:userVisible=\"true|false\"\n *    android:supportsUploading=\"true|false\"\n *    android:allowParallelSyncs=\"true|false\"\n *    android:isAlwaysSyncable=\"true|false\"\n *    android:syncAdapterSettingsAction=\"ACTION_OF_SETTINGS_ACTIVITY\"\n * /&gt;\n * </pre>\n * <ul>\n * <li>The <code>android:contentAuthority</code> and <code>android:accountType</code> attributes\n * indicate which content authority and for which account types this sync adapter serves.\n * <li><code>android:userVisible</code> defaults to true and controls whether or not this sync\n * adapter shows up in the Sync Settings screen.\n * <li><code>android:supportsUploading</code> defaults\n * to true and if true an upload-only sync will be requested for all syncadapters associated\n * with an authority whenever that authority's content provider does a\n * {@link ContentResolver#notifyChange(android.net.Uri, android.database.ContentObserver, boolean)}\n * with syncToNetwork set to true.\n * <li><code>android:allowParallelSyncs</code> defaults to false and if true indicates that\n * the sync adapter can handle syncs for multiple accounts at the same time. Otherwise\n * the SyncManager will wait until the sync adapter is not in use before requesting that\n * it sync an account's data.\n * <li><code>android:isAlwaysSyncable</code> defaults to false and if true tells the SyncManager\n * to initialize the isSyncable state to 1 for that sync adapter for each account that is added.\n * <li><code>android:syncAdapterSettingsAction</code> defaults to null and if supplied it\n * specifies an Intent action of an activity that can be used to adjust the sync adapter's\n * sync settings. The activity must live in the same package as the sync adapter.\n * </ul>\n ",
