A u-coordinate is an\n * element of the field of integers modulo some value that is determined by\n * the algorithm parameters. This field element is represented by a BigInteger\n * which may hold any value. That is, the BigInteger is not restricted to the\n * range of canonical field elements.\n *\n * @since 11\n ",
