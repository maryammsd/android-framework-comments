  "comment" : "\n * <code>PersianCalendar</code> is a subclass of <code>Calendar</code> that\n * that implements the Persian calendar.  It is used as the main civil\n * calendar in Iran and Afghanistan, and by Iranians and Afghans worldwide.\n * <p>\n * The Persian calendar is solar, and is similar to the Gregorian calendar\n * in various ways, except its leap year rule, which is determined\n * astronomically.  The Persian year starts around the March equinox.\n * <p>\n * The modern Persian calendar (used in Iran since 1925 CE and in\n * Afghanistan since 1957 CE), has the lengths of the months fixed.  The\n * first six months are 31 days each, the next five months are 30 days each,\n * and the final month is 29 days in non-leap years and 30 days in leap\n * ones.  Historically, the lengths of the month differed in different\n * years, but they were finally fixed at the times mentioned above.  Partial\n * information is available about the historical lengths.\n * <p>\n * The official rule for determination of the beginning of the Persian year\n * is locale dependent, but at the same time, it has not specified a locale. \n * Iranians around the world traditionally follow the calendar authorities\n * of Iran, which haven't officially specified the locale.  Some\n * calendarists use some point in Tehran as the locale, while others have\n * tried the more neutral 52.5 degrees east meridian.  It is not clear which\n * locale should be used for the Persian calendar of Afghanistan, but it is\n * expected that for about one year in every twenty-four years, the Afghan\n * calendar may become different from the Iranian one.\n * <p> \n * The exact locale to be used for the Iranian calendar starts to make a\n * difference at around 2090 CE.  The specific arithmetic method implemented\n * here, commonly known as the 33-year cycle rule, matches the astronomical\n * calendar at least for the whole period that the calendar has been both\n * well-defined and official, from 1925 to around 2090 CE.  The other\n * commonly known algorithm, the 2820-year cycle, has been incorrectly\n * designed to follow the tropical year instead of the spring equinoctial\n * year, and fails to match the astronomical one as early as 2025 CE.\n * <p>\n * This class should not be subclassed.</p>\n * <p>\n * PersianCalendar usually should be instantiated using\n * {@link android.icu.util.Calendar#getInstance(ULocale)} passing in a\n * <code>ULocale</code> with the tag <code>\"@calendar=persian\"</code>.</p>\n *\n * @see android.icu.util.GregorianCalendar\n * @see android.icu.util.Calendar\n *\n * @author Roozbeh Pournader\n *\n * @deprecated This API is ICU internal only.\n * @hide Only a subset of ICU is exposed in Android\n * @hide draft / provisional / internal are hidden on Android\n ",
