  "comment" : "\n * The Telephony provider contains data related to phone operation, specifically SMS and MMS\n * messages, access to the APN list, including the MMSC to use, and the service state.\n *\n * <p class=\"note\"><strong>Note:</strong> These APIs are not available on all Android-powered\n * devices. If your app depends on telephony features such as for managing SMS messages, include\n * a <a href=\"{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element.html\">{@code <uses-feature>}\n * </a> element in your manifest that declares the {@code \"android.hardware.telephony\"} hardware\n * feature. Alternatively, you can check for telephony availability at runtime using either\n * {@link android.content.pm.PackageManager#hasSystemFeature\n * hasSystemFeature(PackageManager.FEATURE_TELEPHONY)} or {@link\n * android.telephony.TelephonyManager#getPhoneType}.</p>\n *\n * <h3>Creating an SMS app</h3>\n *\n * <p>Only the default SMS app (selected by the user in system settings) is able to write to the\n * SMS Provider (the tables defined within the {@code Telephony} class) and only the default SMS\n * app receives the {@link android.provider.Telephony.Sms.Intents#SMS_DELIVER_ACTION} broadcast\n * when the user receives an SMS or the {@link\n * android.provider.Telephony.Sms.Intents#WAP_PUSH_DELIVER_ACTION} broadcast when the user\n * receives an MMS.</p>\n *\n * <p>Any app that wants to behave as the user's default SMS app must handle the following intents:\n * <ul>\n * <li>In a broadcast receiver, include an intent filter for {@link Sms.Intents#SMS_DELIVER_ACTION}\n * (<code>\"android.provider.Telephony.SMS_DELIVER\"</code>). The broadcast receiver must also\n * require the {@link android.Manifest.permission#BROADCAST_SMS} permission.\n * <p>This allows your app to directly receive incoming SMS messages.</p></li>\n * <li>In a broadcast receiver, include an intent filter for {@link\n * Sms.Intents#WAP_PUSH_DELIVER_ACTION}} ({@code \"android.provider.Telephony.WAP_PUSH_DELIVER\"})\n * with the MIME type <code>\"application/vnd.wap.mms-message\"</code>.\n * The broadcast receiver must also require the {@link\n * android.Manifest.permission#BROADCAST_WAP_PUSH} permission.\n * <p>This allows your app to directly receive incoming MMS messages.</p></li>\n * <li>In your activity that delivers new messages, include an intent filter for\n * {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_SENDTO} (<code>\"android.intent.action.SENDTO\"\n * </code>) with schemas, <code>sms:</code>, <code>smsto:</code>, <code>mms:</code>, and\n * <code>mmsto:</code>.\n * <p>This allows your app to receive intents from other apps that want to deliver a\n * message.</p></li>\n * <li>In a service, include an intent filter for {@link\n * android.telephony.TelephonyManager#ACTION_RESPOND_VIA_MESSAGE}\n * (<code>\"android.intent.action.RESPOND_VIA_MESSAGE\"</code>) with schemas,\n * <code>sms:</code>, <code>smsto:</code>, <code>mms:</code>, and <code>mmsto:</code>.\n * This service must also require the {@link\n * android.Manifest.permission#SEND_RESPOND_VIA_MESSAGE} permission.\n * <p>This allows users to respond to incoming phone calls with an immediate text message\n * using your app.</p></li>\n * </ul>\n *\n * <p>Other apps that are not selected as the default SMS app can only <em>read</em> the SMS\n * Provider, but may also be notified when a new SMS arrives by listening for the {@link\n * Sms.Intents#SMS_RECEIVED_ACTION}\n * broadcast, which is a non-abortable broadcast that may be delivered to multiple apps. This\n * broadcast is intended for apps that&mdash;while not selected as the default SMS app&mdash;need to\n * read special incoming messages such as to perform phone number verification.</p>\n *\n * <p>For more information about building SMS apps, read the blog post, <a\n * href=\"http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2013/10/getting-your-sms-apps-ready-for-kitkat.html\"\n * >Getting Your SMS Apps Ready for KitKat</a>.</p>\n *\n ",
