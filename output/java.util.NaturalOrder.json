To simplify code-sharing within underlying\n     * implementations, the compare method only declares type Object\n     * for its second argument.\n     *\n     * Arrays class implementor's note: It is an empirical matter\n     * whether ComparableTimSort offers any performance benefit over\n     * TimSort used with this comparator.  If not, you are better off\n     * deleting or bypassing ComparableTimSort.  There is currently no\n     * empirical case for separating them for parallel sorting, so all\n     * public Object parallelSort methods use the same comparator\n     * based implementation.\n     ",
