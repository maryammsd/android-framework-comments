  "comment" : "\n * An {@code Error} is a subclass of {@code Throwable}\n * that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application\n * should not try to catch. Most such errors are abnormal conditions.\n * The {@code ThreadDeath} error, though a \"normal\" condition,\n * is also a subclass of {@code Error} because most applications\n * should not try to catch it.\n * <p>\n * A method is not required to declare in its {@code throws}\n * clause any subclasses of {@code Error} that might be thrown\n * during the execution of the method but not caught, since these\n * errors are abnormal conditions that should never occur.\n *\n * That is, {@code Error} and its subclasses are regarded as unchecked\n * exceptions for the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions.\n *\n * @author  Frank Yellin\n * @see     java.lang.ThreadDeath\n * @jls 11.2 Compile-Time Checking of Exceptions\n * @since   1.0\n ",
