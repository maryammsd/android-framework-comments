  "comment" : "\n * <code>DocumentFragment</code> is a \"lightweight\" or \"minimal\"\n * <code>Document</code> object. It is very common to want to be able to\n * extract a portion of a document's tree or to create a new fragment of a\n * document. Imagine implementing a user command like cut or rearranging a\n * document by moving fragments around. It is desirable to have an object\n * which can hold such fragments and it is quite natural to use a Node for\n * this purpose. While it is true that a <code>Document</code> object could\n * fulfill this role, a <code>Document</code> object can potentially be a\n * heavyweight object, depending on the underlying implementation. What is\n * really needed for this is a very lightweight object.\n * <code>DocumentFragment</code> is such an object.\n * <p>Furthermore, various operations -- such as inserting nodes as children\n * of another <code>Node</code> -- may take <code>DocumentFragment</code>\n * objects as arguments; this results in all the child nodes of the\n * <code>DocumentFragment</code> being moved to the child list of this node.\n * <p>The children of a <code>DocumentFragment</code> node are zero or more\n * nodes representing the tops of any sub-trees defining the structure of\n * the document. <code>DocumentFragment</code> nodes do not need to be\n * well-formed XML documents (although they do need to follow the rules\n * imposed upon well-formed XML parsed entities, which can have multiple top\n * nodes). For example, a <code>DocumentFragment</code> might have only one\n * child and that child node could be a <code>Text</code> node. Such a\n * structure model represents neither an HTML document nor a well-formed XML\n * document.\n * <p>When a <code>DocumentFragment</code> is inserted into a\n * <code>Document</code> (or indeed any other <code>Node</code> that may\n * take children) the children of the <code>DocumentFragment</code> and not\n * the <code>DocumentFragment</code> itself are inserted into the\n * <code>Node</code>. This makes the <code>DocumentFragment</code> very\n * useful when the user wishes to create nodes that are siblings; the\n * <code>DocumentFragment</code> acts as the parent of these nodes so that\n * the user can use the standard methods from the <code>Node</code>\n * interface, such as <code>Node.insertBefore</code> and\n * <code>Node.appendChild</code>.\n * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification</a>.\n ",
