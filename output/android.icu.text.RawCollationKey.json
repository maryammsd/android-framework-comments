Unlike the CollationKey, this class do not contain information \n * on the source string the sort order represents. RawCollationKey is mutable \n * and users can reuse its objects with the method in \n * RuleBasedCollator.getRawCollationKey(..).\n * </p>\n * <p>\n * Please refer to the documentation on CollationKey for a detail description\n * on the internal byte representation. Note the internal byte representation \n * is always null-terminated.\n * </p> \n * <code>\n * Example of use:<br>\n * String str[] = {.....};\n * RuleBasedCollator collator = (RuleBasedCollator)Collator.getInstance();\n * RawCollationKey key = new RawCollationKey(128);\n * for (int i = 0; i &lt; str.length; i ++) {\n *     collator.getRawCollationKey(str[i], key);\n *     // do something with key.bytes\n * }\n * </code>\n * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Comparison between RawCollationKeys created by \n * different Collators might return incorrect results.  \n * See class documentation for Collator.</p>\n * @see RuleBasedCollator\n * @see CollationKey\n * @hide Only a subset of ICU is exposed in Android\n ",
