  "comment" : "\n * A calendar system, used to organize and identify dates.\n * <p>\n * The main date and time API is built on the ISO calendar system.\n * The chronology operates behind the scenes to represent the general concept of a calendar system.\n * For example, the Japanese, Minguo, Thai Buddhist and others.\n * <p>\n * Most other calendar systems also operate on the shared concepts of year, month and day,\n * linked to the cycles of the Earth around the Sun, and the Moon around the Earth.\n * These shared concepts are defined by {@link ChronoField} and are available\n * for use by any {@code Chronology} implementation:\n * <pre>\n *   LocalDate isoDate = ...\n *   ThaiBuddhistDate thaiDate = ...\n *   int isoYear = isoDate.get(ChronoField.YEAR);\n *   int thaiYear = thaiDate.get(ChronoField.YEAR);\n * </pre>\n * As shown, although the date objects are in different calendar systems, represented by different\n * {@code Chronology} instances, both can be queried using the same constant on {@code ChronoField}.\n * For a full discussion of the implications of this, see {@link ChronoLocalDate}.\n * In general, the advice is to use the known ISO-based {@code LocalDate}, rather than\n * {@code ChronoLocalDate}.\n * <p>\n * While a {@code Chronology} object typically uses {@code ChronoField} and is based on\n * an era, year-of-era, month-of-year, day-of-month model of a date, this is not required.\n * A {@code Chronology} instance may represent a totally different kind of calendar system,\n * such as the Mayan.\n * <p>\n * In practical terms, the {@code Chronology} instance also acts as a factory.\n * The {@link #of(String)} method allows an instance to be looked up by identifier,\n * while the {@link #ofLocale(Locale)} method allows lookup by locale.\n * <p>\n * The {@code Chronology} instance provides a set of methods to create {@code ChronoLocalDate} instances.\n * The date classes are used to manipulate specific dates.\n * <ul>\n * <li> {@link #dateNow() dateNow()}\n * <li> {@link #dateNow(Clock) dateNow(clock)}\n * <li> {@link #dateNow(ZoneId) dateNow(zone)}\n * <li> {@link #date(int, int, int) date(yearProleptic, month, day)}\n * <li> {@link #date(Era, int, int, int) date(era, yearOfEra, month, day)}\n * <li> {@link #dateYearDay(int, int) dateYearDay(yearProleptic, dayOfYear)}\n * <li> {@link #dateYearDay(Era, int, int) dateYearDay(era, yearOfEra, dayOfYear)}\n * <li> {@link #date(TemporalAccessor) date(TemporalAccessor)}\n * </ul>\n *\n * <h2 id=\"addcalendars\">Adding New Calendars</h2>\n * The set of available chronologies can be extended by applications.\n * Adding a new calendar system requires the writing of an implementation of\n * {@code Chronology}, {@code ChronoLocalDate} and {@code Era}.\n * The majority of the logic specific to the calendar system will be in the\n * {@code ChronoLocalDate} implementation.\n * The {@code Chronology} implementation acts as a factory.\n * <p>\n * To permit the discovery of additional chronologies, the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader ServiceLoader}\n * is used. A file must be added to the {@code META-INF/services} directory with the\n * name 'java.time.chrono.Chronology' listing the implementation classes.\n * See the ServiceLoader for more details on service loading.\n * For lookup by id or calendarType, the system provided calendars are found\n * first followed by application provided calendars.\n * <p>\n * Each chronology must define a chronology ID that is unique within the system.\n * If the chronology represents a calendar system defined by the\n * CLDR specification then the calendar type is the concatenation of the\n * CLDR type and, if applicable, the CLDR variant.\n *\n * @implSpec\n * This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.\n * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.\n * Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.\n *\n * @since 1.8\n ",
