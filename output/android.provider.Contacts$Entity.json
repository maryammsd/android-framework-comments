Entity always contains at least one row per\n         * constituent raw contact, even if there are no actual data rows.

There is significant data duplication\n         * in the Entity (each row repeats all Contact columns and all RawContact\n         * columns), so the benefits of transactional consistency should be weighed\n         * against the cost of transferring large amounts of denormalized data\n         * from the Provider.\n         * </p>\n         * <p>\n         * To reduce the amount of data duplication the contacts provider and directory\n         * providers implementing this protocol are allowed to provide common Contacts\n         * and RawContacts fields in the first row returned for each raw contact only and\n         * leave them as null in subsequent rows.\n         * </p>\n         ",
