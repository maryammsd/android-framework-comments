This interface is included in SAX2 only\n * to support legacy SAX1 applications.</p>\n *\n * <p>The order of events in this interface is very important, and\n * mirrors the order of information in the document itself.  For\n * example, all of an element's content (character data, processing\n * instructions, and/or subelements) will appear, in order, between\n * the startElement event and the corresponding endElement event.</p>\n *\n * <p>Application writers who do not want to implement the entire\n * interface can derive a class from HandlerBase, which implements\n * the default functionality; parser writers can instantiate\n * HandlerBase to obtain a default handler.  The application can find\n * the location of any document event using the Locator interface\n * supplied by the Parser through the setDocumentLocator method.</p>\n *\n * @deprecated This interface has been replaced by the SAX2\n *             {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler ContentHandler}\n *             interface, which includes Namespace support.\n * @since SAX 1.0\n * @author David Megginson\n * @version 2.0.1 (sax2r2)\n * @see org.xml.sax.Parser#setDocumentHandler\n * @see org.xml.sax.Locator\n * @see org.xml.sax.HandlerBase\n ",
